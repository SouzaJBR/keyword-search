However, its open nature and large user base are frequently exploited by automated spammers, content polluters, and other ill-intended users to commit various cybercrimes, such as cyberbullying, trolling, rumor dissemination, and stalking. Accordingly, a number of approaches have been proposed by researchers to address these problems. However, most of these approaches are based on user characterization and completely disregarding mutual interactions. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach for detecting automated spammers by amalgamating community-based features with other feature categories, namely metadata-, content-, and interaction-based features. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the characterization of users based on their interactions with their followers given that a user can evade features that are related to his/her own activities, but evading those based on the followers is difficult. Nineteen different features, including six newly defined features and two redefined features, are identified for learning three classifiers, namely, random forest, decision tree, and Bayesian network, on a real dataset that comprises benign users and spammers. The discrimination power of different feature categories is also analyzed, and interaction- and community-based features are determined to be the most effective for spam detection, whereas metadata-based features are proven to be the least effective. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Social network analysis; social network security; spambot detection; spammer detection",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045323884

The research proposes that consumers’ intentions toward PID depend on their desire for online competition with other OSN users, which in turn depends on user appraisals of available status and hedonic benefits, as well as established social norms around competition. An analysis of data gathered from 499 OSN participants (students enrolled at a state university in the southeastern United States) shows that competitive desires represent an important antecedent of PID behavior in OSN contexts.

By retrieving 307,738 tweets about 30 fake and 30 real news stories, we examined the root content, producers of original source, and evolution patterns. The findings revealed that root tweets about fake news were mostly generated by accounts from ordinary users, but they often included a link to non-credible news websites. Additionally, we observed significant differences between real and fake news stories in terms of evolution patterns. In our evolution tree analysis, tweets about real news showed wider breadth and shorter depth than tweets about fake news. The results also indicated that tweets about real news spread widely and quickly, but tweets about fake news underwent a greater number of modifications in content over the spreading process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Computational social science; Evolution tree analysis; Fake news; Misinformation; Network analysis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042675742

It is assumed in the existing works that there is a single authority whose goal is to minimize the spread of rumor by generating a positive cascade. In this paper, we study a more realistic scenario when there is multiple positive cascades generated by different agents. For the multiple-cascade diffusion, we propose the peer-to-peer independent cascade model for private social communications. The main contribution of this paper is an analysis of the rumor blocking effect (i.e., the number of the users activated by rumor) when the agents noncooperatively generate the positive cascades. We show that the rumor blocking effect provided by the Nash equilibrium will not be arbitrarily worse even if the positive cascades are generated noncooperatively. In addition, we give a discussion on how the cascade priority and activation order affect the rumor blocking problem. We experimentally examine the Nash equilibrium of the proposed games by simulations done on real social network structures. © 2014 IEEE.","Game theory; rumor blocking; social network",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045335557

Previous works studying this problem have mainly focused on graph models with deterministic and homogenous internode relationship strengths. However, internode relationship strengths in real social networks are random. We model this uncertainty by using random, nonhomogenous edge weights on the underlying social network graph. We propose a novel two-stage algorithm that uses the modularity of the social network to locate the source of the rumor with fewer sensor nodes than other existing algorithms. We also propose a novel method to select these sensor nodes. We evaluate our algorithm using a large data set from Twitter and Sina Weibo. Real-world time series data are used to model the uncertainty in social relationship strengths. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can determine the actual source within two hops, 69%-80% of the time, when the diameter of the networks varies between 7 and 13. Our numerical results also show that it is easier to estimate the source of a rumor when the source has higher betweenness centrality. Finally, we demonstrate that our two-stage algorithm outperforms the alternative algorithm in terms of the accuracy of localizing the source. © 2014 IEEE.","Partial observation; probabilistic social relationship strength; rumor source estimation; rumor spreading; social networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042357770

This fast development had interesting effects to increase the connection and information exchange of users, but some negative effects also appeared, including fake accounts number growing day after day. The sockpuppets are the multiple fake accounts created by the same user. They are the source of several types of manipulation such as those created to praise, defend or support a person or organization or to manipulate public opinion. In this article, we present SocksCatch, a complete process to detect and group sockpuppets which is composed of three main phases: first phase is the data collection and selection; second phase is the detection of the sockpuppet accounts using machine learning algorithms; third phase is the grouping of sockpuppet accounts created by the same user using graph theory. Experiments have been performed for the three phases using real data crawled from english Wikipedia. The results compare six machine learning algorithms for the detection phase and show that SocksCatch detects between 89% and 95% of the selected sockpuppets depending on the algorithms. We also compare five community detection algorithms for the grouping phase, and show that SocksCatch's grouped sockpuppets and the real sockpuppet's groups are similar between 80% and 88%, according to the cluster's comparison measures: normalized variation of information (NVI) and normalized mutual information (NMI). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Collaborative project; Community detection; Deception; Graph theory; Machine learning application; Manipulation; Multiple identity; Social media; Sockpuppets",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042924912

Existing studies mainly focus on social networks with only positive (or friendship) relations, while signed networks with also negative (or enemy) relations are seldom studied. Various signed networks commonly exist in real world, e.g. a network indicating friendship/enmity, love/hate or trust/mistrust relationships. In this paper, we propose a new centrality method named CS_TOTR to give a ranking of vertices in directed signed networks. To design this new method, we use the “status theory” for signed networks, and also adopt the vertex ranking algorithm for a tournament and the topological sorting algorithm for a general directed graph. We apply this new centrality method on the famous Sampson Monastery dataset and obtain a convincing result which shows its validity. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company","centrality method; Signed network; status theory; topological sorting; tournament ranking",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047372941

Although it has attracted ever-increasing attention from research community in recent years, existing solutions still suffer from high time complexity and inadequate effectiveness, due to high dynamics of information diffusion and observing just a snapshot of the whole process. To this end, we present a comprehensive study for single information source detection in weighted graphs. Specifically, we first propose a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to detect the information source with other methods as the prior, which ensures our method can be integrated with others naturally. Different from many related works, we exploit both infected nodes and their uninfected neighbors to calculate the effective propagation probability, and then derive the exact formation of likelihood for general weighted graphs. To further improve the efficiency, we design two approximate MAP estimators, namely brute force search approximation (BFSA) and greedy search bound approximation (GSBA), from the perspective of likelihood approximation. BFSA tries to traverse the permitted permutations to directly compute the likelihood, but GSBA exploits a strategy of greedy search to find a surrogate upper bound of the likelihood, and thus avoids the enumeration of permitted permutations. Therefore, detecting with partial nodes and likelihood approximation reduces the computational complexity drastically for large graphs. Extensive experiments on several data sets also clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on detecting the single information source with different settings in weighted graphs.

One of the challenges of crowd sourcing system is to recruit right users to be a part of successful campaigns. Fetching this right group of people, who influence a vast population to adopt information, is termed as influence maximization. Concerns of scalability and effectiveness need an effective and a viable solution. This paper proposes the solution in three stages. At the first stage, the large social network is pruned based on the nodal properties to make the solution scalable. At the second stage, Outdegree Rank (OR), is proposed and at the third stage, Influence Estimation (IE) approach estimates user influence. This work amalgamates aspects of structure, heuristic and user influence, to form STORIE. The proposed approach is compared to standard heuristics, on various experimental setups such as RNNDp, RNUDp and TVM. The spread of information is observed for HEP, PHY, Twitter, Infectious and YouTube data, under Independent Cascade model and STORIE gives optimal results, with an increase up to 50%.

Those platforms enable users to author, publish and share content. Such environments can be used to publish and spread rumors and fake news whether unintentionally or even maliciously. That is why credibility of information in such platforms has been increasingly investigated in many domains (i.e. information sciences, psychology, sociology…etc). This paper proposes a machine learning - based model for Arabic news credibility assessment on Twitter. It uses hybrid set of features that are topic and user related to evaluate news credibility. In addition to the traditional content-related features, Content verifiability and users’ replies polarity analysis used for a more accurate assessment. The proposed model consists of four main modules: a) content parsing and features extraction module, b) content verification module, c) users’ comments polarity evaluation and d) credibility classification module. A data set of 800 Arabic news that are manually labeled is collected from Twitter. Three different classification techniques were applied (Decision tree, support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayesian(NB). For model training and testing, 5-fold cross validations were performed and performance diagnostics were calculated. Results indicate that decision tree achieves TRP higher than SVM by around 2% and 7% than NB, also FPR almost 9% lower than SVM and 10% lower than NB. For precision,recall, f-measure and accuracy, decision tree achieves almost 2% higher than SVM and 7% higher than NB for the tested dataset.

We ask the research question: what pain points in scientific media production afford opportunities for future HCI innovation? We then present a grounded theory analysis of 24 interviews with researchers and media professionals, yielding several key contributions. First, we describe two collaborative domains in scientific media production between research advocates and media outlets.

The main motive for market surveillance is to make the market more efficient and free from rouge elements. Identification of financial rumors is vital for orderly functioning of the stock market. Social media platforms allow spread of unverified information to a large mass quickly due to their interconnected nature and large number of participating members. Due to the deluge of data over various media channels including social media, manual scanning of financial rumors is inefficient. This necessitates the use of a big data infrastructure for collection, storage, and analysis of financial news related data. In this paper, we introduce a framework for automated detection of financial rumors using big data. Our framework is based on extant research on knowledge-based discovery in databases and detection of fraudulent financial activities. We describe an in-depth descriptive case study of the world’s fastest stock exchange, the Bombay Stock Exchange. Through the case, we highlight the importance of analytics for detection of financial rumors and the importance of the big data infrastructure to carry out such a task. We identify several critical factors that lead to successful identification of financial rumors. We believe the framework can be used by market regulators, stock exchanges, and security research agencies to identify information-based market manipulation using a systematic data-driven approach over a big data infrastructure. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Analytics; big data; financial rumors; knowledge discovery; market manipulation; market surveillance; rumor detection; social media; stock exchange",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044606318

Detection of such frauds is a time-consuming and challenging task. Traditionally, researchers have been relying on financial data and/or textual content from financial statements to detect corporate fraud. Guided by systemic functional linguistics (SFL) theory, we propose an analytic framework that taps into unstructured data from financial social media platforms to assess the risk of corporate fraud. We assemble a unique data set including 64 fraudulent firms and a matched sample of 64 nonfraudulent firms, as well as the social media data prior to the firm’s alleged fraud violation in Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs). Our framework automatically extracts signals such as sentiment features, emotion features, topic features, lexical features, and social network features, which are then fed into machine learning classifiers for fraud detection. We evaluate and compare the performance of our algorithm against baseline approaches using only financial ratios and language-based features respectively. We further validate the robustness of our algorithm by detecting leaked information and rumors, testing the algorithm on a new data set, and conducting an applicability check. Our results demonstrate the value of financial social media data and serve as a proof of concept of using such data to complement traditional fraud detection methods.

We introduce and formalize the community deception problem and devise an efficient algorithm that allows to achieve deception by identifying a certain number (β) of C's members connections to be rewired. Deception can be practically achieved in social networks like Facebook by friending or unfriending network members as indicated by our algorithm.

However, utilizing information posted on social media has some potential hazards, one of which is rumor. For instance, on Twitter, thousands of verified and non-verified users post tweets to convey information, and not all information posted on Twitter is genuine. Some of them contain fraudulent and unverified information about different facts/incidents - such information are termed as rumors. Identification of such rumor tweets at early stage in the aftermath of a disaster is the main focus of the current work. To this end, a probabilistic model is adopted by combining prominent features of rumor propagation. Each feature has been coded individually in order to extract tweets that have at least one rumor propagation feature. In addition, content-based analysis has been performed to ensure the contribution of the extracted tweets in terms of probability of being a rumor. The proposed model has been tested over a large set of tweets posted during the 2015 Chennai Floods. The proposed model and other four popular baseline rumor detection techniques have been compared with human annotated real rumor data, to check the efficiency of the models in terms of (i) detection of belief rumors and (ii) accuracy at early stage. It has been observed that around 70% of the total endorsed belief rumors have been detected by proposed model, which is superior to other techniques. Finally, in terms of accuracy, the proposed technique also achieved 0.9904 for the considered disaster scenario, which is better than the other methods. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","Chennai floods; Disaster; Microblogs; Rumor; Twitter",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043402830

Motivated by this need, in this paper, we present a system that supports the automatic classification of multimedia Twitter posts into credible or misleading. The system leverages credibility-oriented features extracted from the tweet and the user who published it, and trains a two-step classification model based on a novel semisupervised learning scheme. The latter uses the agreement between two independent pretrained models on new posts as guiding signals for retraining the classification model. We analyze a large labeled dataset of tweets that shared debunked fake and confirmed real images and videos, and show that integrating the newly proposed features, and making use of bagging in the initial classifiers and of the semisupervised learning scheme, significantly improves classification accuracy.

Classification of social media content is a fundamental task for social media mining, and most existing methods regard it as a text categorization problem and mainly focus on using content features, such as words and hashtags. However, for many emerging applications like fake news and rumor detection, it is very challenging, if not impossible, to identify useful features from content. For example, intentional spreaders of fake news may manipulate the content to make it look like real news. To address this problem, this paper concentrates on modeling the propagation of messages in a social network. Specifically, we propose a novel approach, TraceMiner, to (1) infer embeddings of social media users with social network structures; and (2) utilize an LSTM-RNN to represent and classify propagation pathways of a message. Since content information is sparse and noisy on social media, adopting TraceMiner allows to provide a high degree of classification accuracy even in the absence of content information.

If this party identifies the story as misinformation, it is marked as disputed. However, given the uncertain number of exposures, the high cost of fact checking, and the trade-off between flags and exposures, the above mentioned procedure requires careful reasoning and smart algorithms which, to the best of our knowledge, do not exist to date.

Unfortunately, the quality, trustworthiness, and comprehensiveness of online content related to stock market vary drastically, and a large portion consists of the low-quality news, comments, or even rumors. To address this challenge, we imitate the learning process of human beings facing such chaotic online news, driven by three principles: sequential content dependency, diverse influence, and effective and efficient learning.

Moreover, we apply the self-paced learning mechanism to imitate the third principle. Extensive experiments on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. A further simulation illustrates that a straightforward trading strategy based on our proposed framework can significantly increase the annualized return. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Deep learning; Stock trend prediction; Text mining",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046892380

At the same time, the openness of social media platforms provides opportunities to study how users share and discuss rumours, and to explore how to automatically assess their veracity, using natural language processing and data mining techniques. In this article, we introduce and discuss two types of rumours that circulate on social media: long-standing rumours that circulate for long periods of time, and newly emerging rumours spawned during fast-paced events such as breaking news, where reports are released piecemeal and often with an unverified status in their early stages. We provide an overview of research into social media rumours with the ultimate goal of developing a rumour classification system that consists of four components: rumour detection, rumour tracking, rumour stance classification, and rumour veracity classification. We delve into the approaches presented in the scientific literature for the development of each of these four components. We summarise the efforts and achievements so far toward the development of rumour classification systems and conclude with suggestions for avenues for future research in social media mining for the detection and resolution of rumours. © 2018 ACM.","Disinformation; Misinformation; Rumour classification; Rumour detection; Rumour resolution; Social media; Veracity",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042614195

The techniques employed by such cybercriminals can include clickbait (text or video), advertisement of nonexistent but potentially desirable products, and hoax competitions/giveaways. This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with falling victim to these malicious techniques. An online survey was completed by 295 Malaysian undergraduate students, finding that more than one-third had fallen victim to SNS scams. Logistic regression analysis identified several victimization risk factors including having higher scores in impulsivity (specifically cognitive complexity), using fewer devices for SNSs, and having been on an SNS for a longer duration. No reliable model was found for vulnerability to hoax valuable gift giveaways and ""friend view application"" advertising specifically, but vulnerability to video clickbait was predicted by lower extraversion scores, higher levels of openness to experience, using fewer devices, and being on an SNS for a longer duration. Other personality traits were not associated with either overall victimization susceptibility or increased risk of falling victim to the specific techniques. However, age approached significance within both the video clickbait and overall victimization models. These findings suggest that routine activity theory may be particularly beneficial in understanding and preventing SNSs scam victimization. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","clickbait; cybercrime; fraud; impulsivity; routine activity theory; social networking sites",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041705286

Experimental evidence shows that confirmatory information gets accepted even if containing deliberately false claims, while dissenting information is mainly ignored or might even increase group polarization. It seems reasonable that, to address misinformation problem properly, we have to understand the main determinants behind content consumption and the emergence of narratives on online social media. In this paper we address such a challenge by focusing on the discussion around the Italian Constitutional Referendum by conducting a quantitative, cross-platform analysis on both Facebook public pages and Twitter accounts. We observe the spontaneous emergence of well-separated communities on both platforms. Such a segregation is completely spontaneous, since no contents categorization was performed a priori. By exploring the dynamics behind the discussion, we find that users tend to restrict their attention to a specific set of Facebook pages/Twitter accounts. Finally, taking advantage of automatic topic extraction and sentiment analysis techniques, we are able to identify the most controversial topics inside and across both platforms. Thus, we measure the distance between how a certain topic is presented in the posts/tweets and the related users’ emotional response. Our results provide interesting insights for the understanding of the evolution of the core narratives behind different echo chambers and for the early detection of massive viral phenomena around false claims. © 2017 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046297294

For this reason, in the last years, several data-driven approaches have been proposed to assess the credibility of user-generated content diffused through social media in the form of on-line reviews. Distinct approaches often consider different subsets of characteristics, i.e., features, connected to both reviews and reviewers, as well as to the network structure linking distinct entities on the review-site in exam. This article aims at providing an analysis of the main review- and reviewer-centric features that have been proposed up to now in the literature to detect fake reviews, in particular from those approaches that employ supervised machine learning techniques. These solutions provide in general better results with respect to purely unsupervised approaches, which are often based on graph-based methods that consider relational ties in review sites. Furthermore, this work proposes and evaluates some additional new features that can be suitable to classify genuine and fake reviews. For this purpose, a supervised classifier based on Random Forests have been implemented, by considering both well-known and new features, and a large-scale labeled dataset from which all these features have been extracted. The good results obtained show the effectiveness of new features to detect in particular singleton fake reviews, and in general the utility of this study. © 2017 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046284547

With a unique dataset, we find that identity verification would significantly reduce users’ probability of creating fake posts, but only when users cannot obtain privileged credibility after verification. If identity verification is accompanied by privileged credibility, the association between identity verification and the creation of fake posts is significantly positive.

Furthermore, pairs of individuals usually have different influence strength on different topics, information, ideas and rumors etc. In this paper, we focus on the topic-aware IM problem for large recommendation social networks. We propose a novel TSID propagation model to formulate the multiple topics diffusion in recommendation social networks.

Digital artists can compose artificial images capable of deceiving the great majority of people, turning this into a very dangerous weapon in a timespan currently know as “Fake News/Post-Truth” Era. In this work, we propose a new approach for dealing with the problem of detecting computer generated images, through the application of deep convolutional networks and transfer learning techniques. We start from Residual Networks and develop different models adapted to the binary problem of identifying if an image was, or not, computer generated. Differently from the current state-of-the-art approaches, we do not rely on hand-crafted features, but provide to the model the raw pixel information, achieving the same 0.97 performance of state-of-the-art methods with three main advantages: (i) executes considerably faster than state-of-the-art methods with equivalent accuracy; (ii) eliminates the laborious and manual step of specialized features extraction and selection, and (iii) is very robust against image processing operations as noise addition, blur and JPEG compression. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CG detection; Deep learning; Digital forensics; Fake news; Transfer learning",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046342540

S-IoT accentuates on building convivial circles between the devices, which sanction sharing of information without compromising own performance. Trust and privacy are the two factors responsible for the maintenance of these social circles. Trust establishes faith between the entities and privacy supports abstraction of device information. There exist a plethora of approaches, which fixate on trust and privacy in social networks. However, the subsisting solutions rely on a trust scoring system and utilize a single centralized server for these calculations. Such scoring systems are manipulable by eavesdroppers, which engender erroneous reputation leading to high trust values. Considering the desideratum of an efficient trust and privacy-preserving solution, this paper proposes a novel solution in the form of fission computing. The proposed approach relies on the edge-crowd integration for maintenance of trust and preservation of privacy rules in S-IoT. The proposed solution uses crowdsources as mini-edge servers and entropy modeling for defining trust between the entities. Fission managers are responsible for maintaining the privacy rules, which operate for every S-IoT application. The proposed approach is analyzed through numerical simulations by using a safe network as a performance benchmark. Further, the article presents a case study on the detection of fake news sources in S-IoT as an application of the proposed approach. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Crowdsourcing; Edge-computing; IoT; Privacy; S-IoT; Trust",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040325142

As real world can be better modeled using a network, where each node represents a person, and a link indicates connection between two individuals, researchers have started observing the propagation of rumor as an epidemic spread over a network. This spreading not only depends on the diffusion model but also on the structure of the network.

Detecting these risks with as much anticipation as possible is crucial for prevention. However, much research so far has focused on forensic tools that can be applied only when an attack has been performed. This paper proposes a novel and effective methodology for the early detection of threats in written social media. The goal is to recognize a potential attack before it is consummated, and using a minimum amount of information. The proposed approach considers the use of profile-based representations (PBRs) for this goal. PBRs have multiple benefits, including non-sparsity, low dimensionality, and a proved discriminative power. Moreover, representations for partial documents can be derived naturally with PBRs, which makes them suitable for the addressed problem. Results include empirical evidence on the usefulness of PBRs in the early recognition setting for two tasks in which anticipation is critical: sexual predator detection and aggressive text identification. These results reveal, on the one hand, that PBRs achieve state of the art performance when using full-length documents (i.e., the classical task), and, on the other hand, that the proposed methodology outperforms previous work on early recognition of sexual predators by a considerable margin, while obtaining state of the art performance in aggressive text identification. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best results reported on early recognition for the approached problems. We foresee this work will pave the way for the development of novel methodologies for the problem and will motivate further research from the intelligent systems and text mining communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aggressive text identification; Deception detection; Profile-based representations; Sexual predator detection",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026377974

When a user receives two opposing opinions, they tend to believe the one arrives first. Therefore, once misinformation or rumor is detected, one containment method is to introduce a positive cascade competing against the rumor. Given a budget <formula><tex>$k$</tex></formula>, the rumor blocking problem asks for <formula><tex>$k$</tex></formula> seed users to trigger the spread of a positive cascade such that the number of the users who are not influenced by rumor can be maximized. The prior works have shown that the rumor blocking problem can be approximated within a factor of <formula><tex>$(1 - 1/e)$</tex></formula> by a classic greedy algorithm combined with Monte Carlo simulation. Unfortunately, the Monte Carlo simulation based methods are time consuming and the existing algorithms either trade performance guarantees for practical efficiency or vice versa.

The superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by experiments done on both the real-world and synthetic social networks.

For example, community structures to be detected may be disjointed, overlapping, or hierarchical, whereas on the other hand, community detection methods may vary depending on whether links are weighted or unweighted, directed or undirected, and whether the network is static or dynamic. Although a number of community detection methods exist in literature, most of them address only a particular aspect, and generally, community structures and their evolution analysis are studied separately. However, analyzing community structures and their evolution under a unified framework could be more useful, where community structures provide evidence of community evolution. Moreover, not many researchers have dealt with the issue of the utilization of detected communities and they have simply proposed methods to detect communities without emphasizing their utilities. This chapter presents a unified social network analysis framework that is mainly aimed at addressing the problem of community analysis, including overlapping community detection, community evolution tracking, and hierarchical community structure identification in a unified manner. At the end of this chapter, we present some important application areas in which the knowledge of community structures facilitates the generation of important analytical results and processes to help solve other social network analysis-related problems. The application areas mainly include dealing with spammers, in which we present the importance of various community-based features in learning predictive models for spammer detection in online social networks. In addition, we address the issue of detecting deceptions in online social networks, which mainly includes dealing with cloning attacks, and the importance of community detection for facilitating the process of viral marketing in online social networks. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

To this end, we designed and implemented an algorithm that applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques along with a number of heuristics that reflect the way humans naturally assess emotions in written texts. In order to evaluate the appropriateness of the obtained emotion scores, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey with human raters.

Consequently, social bot detection is of great importance to keep people safe from these harmful effects. In this study, we approach the social bot detection on Twitter as a supervised classification problem and use machine learning algorithms after extensive data preprocessing and feature extraction operations. Large number of features are extracted by analysis of Twitter user accounts for posted tweets, profile information and temporal behaviors. In order to obtain labeled data, we use accounts that are suspended by Twitter with the assumption that majority of these are social bot accounts.

Researchers have addressed this content analysis problem using machine learning tools with innovations in feature engineering as well as algorithm design. However, most of the machine learning approaches use a conventional classification setting, involving training a classifier on a set of features. In this work, we propose a fusion of a pairwise ranking approach and a classification system in detecting tweets with misinformation that include multimedia content. Pairwise ranking allows comparison between two objects and returns a preference score for the first object in the pair in comparison to the second object. We design a ranking system to determine the legitimacy score for a tweet with reference to another tweet from the same topic of discussion (as hashtagged on Twitter), thereby allowing a contextual comparison. Finally, we incorporate the ranking system outputs within the classification system.

When the cascades with different opinions reaching the same user, the cascade arriving first is the most likely to be taken by the user. Therefore, once misinformation or rumor is detected, a natural containment method is to introduce a positive cascade competing against the rumor. Given a budget k, the rumor blocking problem asks for k seed users to trigger the spread of the positive cascade such that the number of the users who are not influenced by rumor can be maximized. The prior works have shown that the rumor blocking problem can be approximated within a factor of (1 - 1/e- δ) by a classic greedy algorithm combined with Monte Carlo simulation with the running time of O(k3 mn ln n/δ2), where n and m are the number of users and edges, respectively. Unfortunately, the Monte-Carlo-simulation-based methods are extremely time consuming and the existing algorithms either trade performance guarantees for practical efficiency or vice versa. In this paper, we present a randomized algorithm which runs in O(km ln n/δ2) expected time and provides a (1 - 1/e - δ)-approximation with a high probability. The experimentally results on both the real-world and synthetic social networks have shown that the proposed randomized rumor blocking algorithm is much more efficient than the state-of-the-art method and it is able to find the seed nodes which are effective in limiting the spread of rumor. © 2017 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034050983

It is often of significant importance to figure out who initially diffuses the information, i.e., finding a rumor source or a trend setter. It is known that such a task is highly challenging and the source detection probability cannot be beyond 31% for regular trees, if we just estimate the source from a given diffusion snapshot. In practice, finding the source often entails the process of querying that asks 'Are you the rumor source?' or 'Who tells you the rumor?' that would increase the chance of detecting the source. In this paper, we consider two kinds of querying: (a) simple batch querying and (b) interactive querying with direction under the assumption that queriees can be untruthful with some probability. We propose estimation algorithms for those queries, and quantify their detection performance and the amount of extra budget due to untruthfulness, analytically showing that querying significantly improves the detection performance.

This problem is important and challenging in different contexts of computer or social networks, which is made more difficult in many applications where we have access only to a limited set of observations.

For this reason, assessing and mining the credibility of both sources of information and information itself constitute nowadays a fundamental issue. Credibility, also referred as believability, is a quality perceived by individuals, who are not always able to discern with their cognitive capacities genuine information from the fake one. For this reason, in the recent years several approaches have been proposed to automatically assess credibility in Social Media. Most of them are based on data-driven models, i.e., they employ machine-learning techniques to identify misinformation, but recently also model-driven approaches are emerging, as well as graph-based approaches focusing on credibility propagation. Since multiple social applications have been developed for different aims and in different contexts, several solutions have been considered to address the issue of credibility assessment in Social Media. Three of the main tasks facing this issue and considered in this article concern: (1) the detection of opinion spam in review sites, (2) the detection of fake news and spam in microblogging, and (3) the credibility assessment of online health information. Despite the high number of interesting solutions proposed in the literature to tackle the above three tasks, some issues remain unsolved; they mainly concern both the absence of predefined benchmarks and gold standard datasets, and the difficulty of collecting and mining large amount of data, which has not yet received the attention it deserves.

More than 100,000 Weibo posts were collected and categorized into three data sets: rumor discussion posts from the public, rumor-debunking posts from Weibo's official rumor rebuttal accounts, and posts removed from the system. Two content-moderation rumor strategies, namely rumor rebuttal and content removal, were identified. Clustering analysis and time series analysis was applied to test how these two strategies were used to filter posts of different topics and how they were associated with public discussion of rumor-related topics. Our findings suggest that the platform's response to rumor varied depending on the political sensitivity of the topic. Time-series analysis indicated that the implementation of both strategies was usually associated with a subsequent increase in general discussion about the rumor, suggesting that these strategies do not create a consistent chilling effect on public speech. © 2017 Policy Studies Organization","collective action; content moderation; emergency communication; Internet censorship; online protest; online rumor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026428660

For identifying more accurately and efficiently, we make a further analysis for the real information spread and find that the information is commonly topic sensitive and opinion leaders are always topic limited. In the certain topic area, the users with higher authority in the topic area always play a more crucial role for the information spread. What’s more, in order to quantify the authority in certain topic area, we apply a series of rigorous definitions and topic model. Finally, comparing with the other widely used methods, the result shows the effective performance of our method. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Information spread; Opinion leaders; Social networks; Topic limited",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010822640

However, SNs also bring in new threats to smart grid: misinformation in SNs may cause smart grid users to alter their demand, resulting in transmission line overloading and in turn leading to catastrophic impact to the grid. In this paper, we discuss the interdependence in the SN coupled smart grid and focus on its vulnerability. That is, how much can the smart grid be damaged when misinformation related to it diffuses in SNs? To analytically study the problem, we propose the misinformation attack problem in social-smart grid that identifies the top critical nodes in the SN, such that the smart grid can be greatly damaged when misinformation propagates from those nodes. This problem is challenging as we have to incorporate the complexity of the two networks concurrently. Nevertheless, we propose a technique that can explicitly take into account information diffusion in SN, power flow balance, and cascading failure in smart grid integratedly when evaluating node criticality, based on which we propose various strategies in selecting the most critical nodes. Also, we introduce controlled load shedding as a protection strategy to reduce the impact of cascading failure. The effectiveness of our algorithms is demonstrated by experiments on the IEEE bus test cases as well as the Pegase data set. © 2013 IEEE.","cascading failure; interdependent networks; power grid; smart grid; Social network",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028735582

Given the huge amount of sensitive data available in social network platforms, user privacy protection on social networks has become one of the most urgent research issues. As a traditional information stealing technique, phishing attacks still work in their way to cause a lot of privacy violation incidents. In a Web-based phishing attack, an attacker sets up scam Web pages (pretending to be an important Website such as a social network portal) to lure users to input their private information, such as passwords, social security numbers, credit card numbers, and so on. In fact, the appearance of Web pages is among the most important factors in deceiving users, and thus, the similarity among Web pages is a critical metric for detecting phishing Websites. In this paper, we present a new solution, called Phishing-Alarm, to detect phishing attacks using features that are hard to evade by attackers. In particular, we present an algorithm to quantify the suspiciousness ratings of Web pages based on the similarity of visual appearance between the Web pages. Since cascading style sheet (CSS) is the technique to specify page layout across browser implementations, our approach uses CSS as the basis to accurately quantify the visual similarity of each page element. As page elements do not have the same influence to pages, we base our rating method on weighted page-component similarity. We prototyped our approach in the Google Chrome browser. Our large-scale evaluation using real-world websites shows the effectiveness of our approach. The proof of concept implementation verifies the correctness and accuracy of our approach with a relatively low performance overhead. © 2013 IEEE.","browser; Phishing; privacy protection; Web security",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028505893

By ""saturation,"" we mean a state during the seed selection process after which adjoining new nodes to the initial set will have a negligible effect on increasing the influence spread.

The results show evidence that increasing the number of samples will result in a better performance on the relevancy classification task, even when relaxing in the number of evaluations per post. In addition, results show that there are significant correlations between the relevance of a post and its interest and whether is meaningfully for the majority of people.

It is very important not just to determine the veracity of information but also the authenticity of the users who spread the information, especially in time-critical situations like real-world emergencies, where urgent measures have to be taken for stopping the spread of fake information. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning based approach for automatic identification of the users spreading rumorous information by leveraging the concept of believability, i.e., the extent to which the propagated information is likely to be perceived as truthful, based on the trust measures of users in Twitter’s retweet network. We hypothesize that the believability between two users is proportional to the trustingness of the retweeter and the trustworthiness of the tweeter, which are two complementary measures of user trust and can be inferred from retweeting behaviors using a variant of HITS algorithm. With the retweet network edge-weighted by believability scores, we use network representation learning to generate user embeddings, which are then leveraged to classify users into as rumor spreaders or not. Based on experiments on a very large real-world rumor dataset collected from Twitter, we demonstrate that our method can effectively identify rumor spreaders and outperform four strong baselines with large margin. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040229823

In particular, given a snapshot observation of the rumor graph, how to accurately identify the initial source of the spreading? In the seminal work by Shah and Zaman in 2011, this statistical inference problem was formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation problem and solved using a rumor centrality approach for graphs that are degree-regular. This however is optimal only if there are no boundary effects, e.g., the underlying number of susceptible vertices is countably infinite. In general, all practical real world networks are finite or exhibit complex spreading behavior, and therefore these boundary effects cannot be ignored. In this paper, we solve the constrained maximum likelihood estimation problem by a generalized rumor centrality for spreading in graphs with boundary effects. We derive a graph-theoretic characterization of the maximum likelihood estimator for degree-regular graphs with a single end vertex at its boundary and propose a message-passing algorithm that is near-optimal for graphs with more complex boundary consisting of multiple end vertices. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040254305

We propose a generalizable and highly automated 3-tier pipeline which utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to extract high-level human understandable image descriptors. We used these descriptors to associate themes and sentiment with images, and analyzed over 57,000 images related to the Paris Attacks. We discovered multiple visual themes which were popular in images, but were not identifiable through text. We also uncovered instances of misinformation and false flag (conspiracy) theories among popular image themes, which were not prominent in user-generated textual content. Further, our analysis revealed that while textual content posted after the attacks reflected negative sentiment, images inspired positive sentiment.

Their outbreak is often followed by the spread of 'counter-rumours', which are messages that debunk rumours. The probability of a tweet to be a counter-rumour is referred to as 'tweet veracity' in this paper. Since both rumours and counter-rumours are expected to contain claims of truth, the two might not be easily distinguishable. If Internet users fail to separate rumours from counter-rumours, the latter will not serve its purpose. Hence, this paper investigates the extent to which tweet veracity could be predicted by content as well as contributors' profile. The investigation focuses on the death hoax case of Singapore's first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on Twitter. A total of 1,000 tweets (500 rumours + 500 counter-rumours) are analyzed using binomial logistic regression. Results indicate that tweet veracity could be predicted by clarity, proper nouns, visual cues, references to credible sources, as well as contributors' duration of membership, and number of followers.

Thousands of forums, blogs, and alternative news sources amplify inaccurate information to such a degree that it impacts our collective intelligence. Widespread misinformation is troubling, not just because it is wrong, but also because it can persist in the face of attempts to correct it, and thus becomes part of a larger culture of community-based pseudoknowledge (PK). Prior work has focused on the motivations and psychology of those who create and maintain PK but has neglected inspection of the dynamics of collective PK production itself. In this exploratory case study, we illustrate how the active participation of multiple collaborators adapts PK over time through a process we liken to participatory storytelling. We argue that the Internet provides a uniquely well-suited environment for evolving PK that is ""more fit"", in that it is more engaging, easier to defend, and possibly easier to spread. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

This paper aims to study the combined impact of psychological factor, propagation delay, network topology and control strategy on rumour diffusion over the online social networks. Based on an online social network, which is seen as a scale-free network, we model the spread of rumours by using a delayed SIS (Susceptible and Infected) epidemic-like model with consideration of psychological factor and network topology. First, through theoretical analysis, we illustrate the boundedness of the density of rumour-susceptible individuals and rumour-infected individuals. Second, we obtain the basic reproduction number R0 and prove the stability of the non-rumour equilibrium point and the rumour-spreading equilibrium point. Third, control strategies, such as uniform immunisation control, proportional immunisation control, targeted immunisation control and optimum control, are put forward to restrain rumour diffusion. Meanwhile, we have compared the differences of these control strategies.

Over the past decades, researchers have proposed a number of algorithmic design methods for graph clustering. However, most of these methods are based on complicated spectral techniques or convex optimisation, and cannot be applied directly for clustering many networks that occur in practice, whose information is often collected on different sites. Designing a simple and distributed clustering algorithm is of great interest, and has wide applications for processing big datasets. In this paper we present a simple and distributed algorithm for graph clustering: for a wide class of graphs that are characterised by a strong cluster-structure, our algorithm finishes in a poly-logarithmic number of rounds, and recovers a partition of the graph close to an optimal partition. The main component of our algorithm is an application of the random matching model of load balancing, which is a fundamental protocol in distributed computing and has been extensively studied in the past 20 years. Hence, our result highlights an intrinsic and interesting connection between graph clustering and load balancing. At a technical level, we present a purely algebraic result characterising the early behaviours of load balancing processes for graphs exhibiting a cluster-structure. We believe that this result can be further applied to analyse other gossip processes, such as rumour spreading and averaging processes. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Graph clustering; Load balancing; Spectral graph theory",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027851374

We usually monitor only a few users of detecting various risks due to the resource constraints and privacy protection. This leads to a critical problem to detect compromised users who are out of surveillance. In this paper, we propose a risk assessment method to address this problem. The aim is to assess the security status of unmonitored users according to the limited information collected from monitored users in networks. There are two innovative techniques developed: First, we identify the source of risk propagation by inversely disseminating risks from the influenced (by rumours) or infected (by viruses) monitored users. We show a new finding that the ones who synchronously receive the risk copies from all monitored users are most likely to be the sources. Second, we propose a microscopic mathematical model to present the risk propagation from the exposed sources. This model forms a discriminant to classify the compromised users from others. For evaluations, we collect three real networks on which we launch simulated risk propagation and then sample the status of monitored users. The experiment results show that our method is effective and the result of risk assessment well matches the real status of the unmonitored users. © 2017 IEEE.","Modelling; Risk assessment; Source identification",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027266425

In this work, we developed models for automated verification of rumors (unverified information) that propagate through Twitter. To predict the veracity of rumors, we identified salient features of rumors by examining three aspects of information spread: linguistic style used to express rumors, characteristics of people involved in propagating information, and network propagation dynamics. The predicted veracity of a time series of these features extracted from a rumor (a collection of tweets) is generated using Hidden Markov Models. The verification algorithm was trained and tested on 209 rumors representing 938,806 tweets collected from real-world events, including the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, the 2014 Ferguson unrest, and the 2014 Ebola epidemic, and many other rumors about various real-world events reported on popular websites that document public rumors. The algorithm was able to correctly predict the veracity of 75% of the rumors faster than any other public source, including journalists and law enforcement officials. The ability to track rumors and predict their outcomes may have practical applications for news consumers, financial markets, journalists, and emergency services, and more generally to help minimize the impact of false information on Twitter. © 2017 ACM","Fake news; Propagation; Rumor; Twitter; Veracity prediction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026522971

About 8.7% of the total accounts of Facebook are fake or duplicate. These fake accounts are spreading rumors. Facebook believes 14.3 million of these accounts were created for spamming. Sometimes these accounts are being used to fulfil personal vendetta. Using spam filters seems to be insufficient as Facebook is struggling to clean up the spam while users are falling in traps like clickbait. On the other hand rumors in SNS causing severe trouble on a large scale. In recent time a violent incident took place in Ramu, Bangladesh on the basis of a rumor spread through Facebook. Rumors like this affecting us as individuals, our society. The main challenge of a rumor detection tool is the accuracy of the system and the time it takes to give the results. An accuracy having 90% accuracy may not be enough in the time of natural disasters or war as remaining 10% can cause havoc. Again if the system takes too much time no matter what the result is, it may be too late. We designed a tool which can quickly detect if a post is a spam or rumor.

Limiting the spread of rumor on social networks has become an important task. One approach is to identify nodes to start a truth campaign such that when users are aware of the truth, they would not believe or propagate the rumor. However, existing works do not take into account the delays of information diffusion or the time point beyond which propagation of misinformation is no longer critical. In this paper, we consider a more realistic situation where information is propagated with delays and the goal is to reduce the number of rumor-infected users before a deadline. We call this the Temporal Influence Blocking (TIB) problem.

In that case, a very popular online social network like twitter can be an effective tool, where people can share their views and knowledge about what is actually happening in the affected areas. It is a very challenging task to analyze the situation during the golden hours of any large scale disaster due to the absence of any renowned news media. All the tweets posted related to disaster are not genuine. Hence, some filtration must be performed to discard rumor tweets. After eliminating rumors, it has been observed that the volume of genuine tweets obtained is also very large. Thus, it is non-trivial for relief or rescue teams to analyze that large number of tweets and to take any decision regarding the relief and rescue as manual processing of those large numbers of tweets take significant amount of time. It is necessary to devise a summarization technique for efficient processing and analysis of genuine information at any point of time. In this work, an FOPL based summarization technique has been adopted to summarize the genuine tweets.

Understanding how and why rumors spread in these contexts could assist in the design of systems that facilitate timely and accurate sensemaking. We address a basic question in this line: To what extent does rumor evolution occur (1) through reliance on a centralized information source, (2) in parallel information silos, or (3) through a web of complex informational interactions? We develop a conceptual model and associated analysis algorithms that allow us to distinguish between these possibilities. We analyze a case of rumoring on Twitter during the Boston Marathon Bombing. We find that rumor spreading was predominantly a parallel process in this case, which is consistent with a hypothesis that information silos may underlie the persistence of false rumors. Special attention towards detecting and resolving parallel information threads during collective sensemaking may hence be warranted. © 2017 ACM.","Collective intelligence; Collective sensemaking; Computational modeling; Computational social science; Rumor evolution; Rumor spreading; Rumoring; Social media; Sociotechnical systems; Twitter",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044857665

The model utilizes the node degree to describe the dynamic changes of the number of rumor spreaders and it can be regarded as an extension of the traditional SIR model. Stability analysis of the model reveals that the spreader in social networks has a basic reproduction number. If the basic reproduction number is less than 1, then rumors will disappear. Otherwise, rumors will persist. According to this result, we can predict the trend of rumor spreading. Then we propose an immune-structure SIR model to explore the control method of rumor spreading.

Most of the time we use the applications to share important information and urgent messages or news with our dearest ones because we care. But time and time again, we see headlines highlighting the misuse of these applications to spread false rumors and its damaging impacts. From the point of view of technology, there is almost no help at all in verifying the genuineness of a message shared. Users have to go great lengths to verify the news, but responsible users are not common these days. Furthermore the urgency of these messages sometimes calls to our natural instinct to protect our loved ones. Motivated by this challenge, we propose a mobile application; MyVeri5, to facilitate in checking the genuine status of messages. Through MyVeri5, users who want to verify a message can request to do so by forwarding said messages to the system’s server. The system’s server will forward the message to appointed authorized verifiers from appropriate domains for verification. The verified status of the message will be returned to the requesting user, along with his immediate friends list. MyVeri5 has the potential to minimize the impact of fake messages socially and economically, while still servicing the need for urgency to inform the loved ones.

How quickly does a piece of news spread over these media? How does its popularity diminish over time? Does the rising and falling pattern follow a simple universal law? In this article, we propose SPIKEM, a concise yet flexible analytical model of the rise and fall patterns of information diffusion. Our model has the following advantages. First, unification power: it explains earlier empirical observations and generalizes theoretical models including the SI and SIR models. We provide the threshold of the take-off versus die-out conditions for SPIKEMand discuss the generality of our model by applying it to an arbitrary graph topology. Second, practicality: it matches the observed behavior of diverse sets of real data. Third, parsimony: it requires only a handful of parameters. Fourth, usefulness: it makes it possible to perform analytic tasks such as forecasting, spotting anomalies, and interpretation by reverse engineering the system parameters of interest (quality of news, number of interested bloggers, etc.). We also introduce an efficient and effective algorithm for the real-Time monitoring of information diffusion, namely SPIKESTREAM, which identifies multiple diffusion patterns in a large collection of online event streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that SPIKEM accurately and succinctly describes all patterns of the rise and fall spikes in social networks. © 2017 ACM.","Information diffusion; Nonlinear modeling; Social networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018839618

However, the spread of rumors in MSNs present a massive social threat. Currently, there are two kinds of methods to address this: blocking rumors at influential users and spreading truth to clarify rumors. However, most existing works either overlook the cost of various methods or only consider different methods individually. This paper proposes a heterogeneous-network-based epidemic model that incorporates the two kinds of methods to describe rumor spreading in MSNs. Moreover, two cost-efficient strategies are designed to restrain rumors. The first strategy is the real-Time optimization strategy that minimizes the rumor-restraining cost by optimally combining various rumor-restraining methods such that a rumor can be extinct within an expected time period. The second strategy is the pulse spreading truth and continuous blocking rumor strategy that restrains rumor spreading through spreading truth periodically. The two strategies can restrain rumors in a continuous or periodical manner and guarantee cost efficiency. The experiments toward the Digg2009 data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the efficiency of the two strategies. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Blocking rumors; maximum immunization period; Pontryagin's maximum principle; pulse immunization; spreading truth",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010714628

Each contagion appears in some node and spreads through the nodes over the underlying network. In most cases, the network structure is hidden and we can only observe the times at which nodes are infected by contagions. So, inferring network structures and analyzing information diffusion processes are required in various domains. The vast majority of existing methods are parametric with the assumption that the diffusion patterns of contagions follow a particular distribution. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric method to infer the network topology, regardless of the contagion propagation model. We consider a static network and a set of given observed cascades, then, we try to infer not only the edges of the network; but also their strengths. First, we model the diffusion network as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition probabilities are assumed as pairwise transmission rates between the nodes. Later, a reinforcement learning paradigm is employed to solve this MDP. As compared to other methods, we do not make any assumption about the information diffusion pattern in our method; making it more general purpose. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for different types of network structures and propagation models. © 2017 IEEE.","Diffusion cascades; inferring network structure; information diffusion; Markov decision process (MDP); reinforcement learning (RL); social network",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015321291

Finding the sources of topic on the online social networks (OSNs), which helps us to know the cause of events, to identify the authenticity of the topic and to target the origin of rumors, is very important. However, topic sources locating is difficult because the structure of OSNs is complex and the complete OSNs are hard to observe. At the same time, the fact that the topic diffusion process is multiple-source, asynchronous and uncertain, causes topic sources locating to be more difficult. In this paper we aim to solve the problem of the topic sources locating in the uncertainty diffusion networks .We first analyzed the uncertainty diffusion relationship in detail through the real data sets. Then according to the characteristics of incomplete observation and asynchronous transmission, we propose a dynamic locating method based on the activation time and the partial topology structure from a subnet transition to earlier subnet.

Besides revealing information about social interactions between individuals, MSNs can assist smart city applications through crowdsensing services. In presence of malicious users who aim at misinformation through manipulation of their sensing data, trustworthiness arises as a crucial issue for the users who receive service from smart city applications. In this paper, the authors propose a new crowdsensing framework, namely Social Network Assisted Trustworthiness Assurance (SONATA) which aims at maximizing crowdsensing platform utility and minimizing the manipulation probability through vote-based trustworthiness analysis in dynamic social network architecture. SONATA adopts existing Sybil detection techniques to identify malicious users who aim at misinformation/disinformation at the crowdsensing platform. The authors present performance evaluation of SONATA under various crowdsensing scenarios in a smart city setting. Performance results show that SONATA improves crowdsensing utility under light and moderate arrival rates of sensing task requests when less than 7% of the users are malicious whereas crowdsensing utility is significantly improved under all task arrival rates if the ratio of malicious users to the entire population is at least 7%. Furthermore, under each scenario, manipulation ratio is close to zero under SONATA while trustworthiness unaware recruitment of social network users leads to a manipulation probability of 2.5% which cannot be tolerated in critical smart city applications such as disaster management or public safety. © 2017 by IGI Global.

However, these methods rarely take the space-time dynamic of rumor propagation into consideration. The selected controlled user nodes or bridges may be unable to inuence the propagation process actually at current time if they are far from the rumor source or they have already undergone the rumor before. In the above mentioned two scenarios, it will be meaningless to control so-called important users and community bridges. In our work, we aim to restrain the rumor by predicting propagation dynamic from the microscopic perspective and collecting the boundary users who are most likely to be contagious at the moment. Moreover, to predict rumor's propagation dynamic practicably and efficiently, we adopt the sensor observation and meanwhile assume that there exist some short propagation paths which are explicit. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed microscopic model's estimations rather accurately predict the propagation dynamic of the rumor. Moreover, the proposed rumor restraining method outperforms evidently classic Degree Centrality and Target Immunization approaches regarding the immunity scale and the immunity speed. © 2017 ACM.","Boundary users; Online Social Networks; Propagation paths; Rumor restraining; Sensor observation",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014951238

Especially, with the unprecedented growth of different types of social and enterprise networks, rumors could reach a larger audience than before. Many researchers have proposed different approaches to analyze and detect rumors in social networks. However, most of them either study on theoretical models without real data experiments or use content-based analysis and limited information diffusion analysis without fully considering social interactions. In this paper, we propose a social interaction based model FAST by taking four major properties of social interactions into account including familiarity, activeness, similarity, and trustworthiness. Also, we evaluate our model on real data from Sina Weibo (Twitter-like social network in China), which contains around 200 million tweets and 14 million Weibo users. Based on our model, we create a new metrics Fractional Directed Power Community Index (FD-PCI) derived from μ-PCI to identify the influential spreaders in social networks.

The proliferation of location spoofing in recent years has stirred debate about the reliability and convenience of user-generated geospatial contents and the use of location spoofing as an effective countermeasure to protect individual geo-privacy and national security. However, these polarized views do not contribute to a holistic understanding of location spoofing. As of today, we still lack a robust method for detecting location spoofing and comprehending its multifaceted implications. The goal of this article is to develop a quantitative approach for detecting location spoofing and a qualitative approach for probing the possible motivations of this growing practice and its inherent uncertainties. We tested our Bayesian time geographic approach for detection using millions of geo-tagged tweets–a major source of big data for studying the spatial-temporal patterns of human activities. Our results indicate that the proposed approach can successfully detect certain types of location spoofing and more research is needed about the detection and implications of location spoofing in the age of wide-spread fake news. Rather than simply dismissing location spoofing as a technical nuisance, this article calls the GIScience community to confront this thorny issue head-on, especially when any arguments or policies are drawn from geospatial big data.

However, the properties of the three types of messages are relatively unknown particularly in the social media context. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to examine these three types of messages posted on social media in the wake of a rumor outbreak. Design/methodology/approach: Data included tweets posted after the outbreak of a rumor that wrongly accused the fast food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) for selling rats instead of chicken. Using a deductive approach, codes were derived via content analysis on the tweets. Volume and exposure of tweets were also examined. Findings: Counter-rumor tweets (52 percent) outnumbered rumors tweets (32 percent) and uncertainty-expressing tweets (16 percent). Emotions and personal involvement were abundant in rumor tweets. Expressions of credence and references to URLs were high in counter-rumor tweets. Social ties were found widely in uncertainty-expressing tweets. The high volume and exposure of counter-rumor tweets compared with those of either rumor tweets or uncertainty-expressing tweets highlight the potential of counter-rumors to mitigate rumors. Originality/value: This research ventures into a relatively unexplored territory by concurrently examining rumor messages, counter-rumor messages and uncertainty-expressing messages in the wake of a rumor outbreak. It reveals that counter-rumor messages have the potential to mitigate rumors on social media. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Counter-rumor; Crisis informatics; Online rumors; Rumoring phenomena; Social media; User-generated content",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032339372

Originality/value: Fake news is a widely discussed topic right now. As this is primarily an issue of information literacy, library and information professionals need to understand, discuss, and address this issue as one that is directly related to the profession. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Click market; Clickbait; Fake news; News; Post-truth; Social media",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028948878

Rumors could be easily propagated and received by a large number of users in social media, resulting in catastrophic effects in the physical world in a very short period. It is a challenging task, if not impossible, to apply classical supervised learning methods to the early detection of rumors, since the labeling process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Motivated by the fact that abundant label information of historical rumors is publicly available, in this paper, we propose to investigate whether knowledge learned from historical data could potentially help identify newly emerging rumors. In particular, since a disputed factual claim arouses certain reactions such as curiosity, skepticism, and astonishment, we identify and utilize patterns from prior labeled data to help reveal emergent rumors. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness. Further experiments are conducted to show how much earlier it can detect an emerging rumor than traditional approaches.

Social network sites (SNSs) have revolutionized the way in which information is spread by allowing users to freely share content. As a consequence, SNSs are also increasingly used as vectors for the diffusion of misinformation and hoaxes. The amount of disseminated information and the rapidity of its diffusion make it practically impossible to assess reliability in a timely manner, highlighting the need for automatic online hoax detection systems. As a contribution towards this objective, we show that Facebook posts can be classified with high accuracy as hoaxes or non-hoaxes on the basis of the users who “liked” them. We present two classification techniques, one based on logistic regression, the other on a novel adaptation of boolean crowdsourcing algorithms. On a dataset consisting of 15,500 Facebook posts and 909,236 users, we obtain classification accuracies exceeding 99% even when the training set contains less than 1% of the posts. We further show that our techniques are robust: they work even when we restrict our attention to the users who like both hoax and non-hoax posts.

These have not only changed the traditional form of news reporting but also provided new opportunities for geographic science. Social media data is embedded with rich geographic information and often referred as 'geotags,' in the form of longitude and latitude coordinates. Very recently, there have been efforts to integrate twitter data with border security and crime related intelligence investigations. Given the current challenges faced by the scientific community for analysing crime scenario through social media, this paper discusses a novel 'Tweet to Map' framework for understanding geospatial environments of crimes discussed or spread as rumours in social media (Facebook and Twitter in particular). It is broadly discussed in three components. Firstly, it discusses crime scenario, role of social media and relevance for developing innovative data mining techniques. In this component it also develops a holistic framework that can help in analysing a good amount of distorted data discussed in the form of tweets or posts, which may have relevance to track and map geospatial information regarding crimes. Secondly, this study explains various steps and application procedures in adopting data mining techniques and analysis using Web GIS for mapping geospatial information of crime data in social media.

Americans increasingly get information from social media, public distrust in the mainstream media is growing and “fake news” is an important new phenomenon. This paper examines the factors that influence trust in scientific claims posted via social media, including the use of hyperlinks and readers' values. The paper describes a crowdsourcing-based experimental design using Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. The core of the experiment was a set of 10 scientific findings reported in open-access, peer-reviewed scientific journals, which were in turn linked to in articles in both the mainstream media and “fake news” sites. Data analysis involved exploration of relationships between trust and the presence or absence of hyperlinks, and between trust and human values using nonparametric statistical methods. In terms of the influence of hyperlinks on trust, inclusion of hyperlinks to scientific journals, mainstream media articles, and even hidden URLs led to higher trust than hyperlinks to “fake news” sites or posts without hyperlinks (p < 0.001). Participants who clicked on hyperlinks to scientific articles placed higher trust in the claims than those who did not (p < 0.001). In terms of the influence of values on trust, values had the most impact in cases where individuals saw, but decided not to click on, hyperlinks; this finding seems to indicate that in the absence of firsthand examination of the hyperlinked sites, participants tend to rely more heavily on their values to determine their trust in a scientific claim. These findings indicate that both the presence and absence of hyperlinks and the values of the reader both significantly impact trust judgments. © 2017 Nitin Verma, Kenneth R.

Therefore, how to automatically identify rumors in social media has attracted much research attention. Most existing studies address this problem by extracting features from the contents of rumors and their reposts as well as the users involved. For these features, especially diffusion features, these works ignore systematic analysis and the exploration of difference between rumors and non-rumors, which exert targeted effect on rumor identification. In this paper, we systematically investigate this problem from a diffusion perspective using Sina Weibo data. We first extract a group of new features from the diffusion processes of messages and then make a few important observations on them. Based on these features, we develop classifiers to discriminate rumors and non-rumors.

This continuous change comes from concerns around privacy, a potential desire for to be forgotten and suspicious behavior. In this study we present a novel task - predicting suspicious e.g., to be deleted or suspended accounts in social media. We analyze multiple datasets of thousands of active, deleted and suspended Twitter accounts to produce a series of predictive representations for the removal or shutdown of an account. We selected these accounts from speakers of three languages - Russian, Spanish, and English to evaluate if speakers of various languages behave differently with regards to deleting accounts. We compared the predictive power of the state-of-the-art machine learning models to recurrent neutral networks trained on previously unexplored features. Furthermore, this work is the first to rely on image and affect signals in addition to language and network to predict deleted and suspended accounts in social media. We found that unlike widely used profile and network features, the discourse of deleted or suspended versus active accounts forms the basis for highly accurate account deletion and suspension prediction. More precisely, we observed that the presence of certain terms in tweets leads to a higher likelihood for that user's account deletion or suspension. Moreover, despite image and affect signals yield lower predictive performance compared to language, they reveal interesting behavioral differences across speakers of different languages. Our extensive analysis and novel findings on language use and suspicious behavior of speakers of different languages can improve the existing approaches to credibility analysis, disinformation and deception detection in social media. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

However, although these methods produced a high accuracy, they are mainly reactive to the issue of identity deception. This paper proposes a proactive approach that leverages social network data and it is focused on identity deception prevention for online sub-communities, communities that exist within larger communities (e.g., Facebook groups or Subreddits).

However, existing automated methods do not perform very well for early rumor detection, which is crucial in many settings, e.g., in crisis situations. One reason for this is that aggregated rumor features such as propagation features, which work well on the long run, are - due to their accumulating characteristic - not very helpful in the early phase of a rumor. In this work, we present an approach for early rumor detection, which leverages Convolutional Neural Networks for learning the hidden representations of individual rumor-related tweets to gain insights on the credibility of each tweets. We then aggregate the predictions from the very beginning of a rumor to obtain the overall event credits (so-called wisdom), and finally combine it with a time series based rumor classification model. Our extensive experiments show a clearly improved classification performance within the critical very first hours of a rumor. For a better understanding, we also conduct an extensive feature evaluation that emphasized on the early stage and shows that the low-level credibility has best predictability at all phases of the rumor lifetime. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029512587

It is urgent to achieve goals of misinformation identification and early detection in social media. In dynamic and complicated social media scenarios, some conventional methods mainly concentrate on feature engineering which fail to cover potential features in new scenarios and have difficulty in shaping elaborate high-level interactions among significant features. Moreover, a recent Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based method suffers from deficiencies that it is not qualified for practical early detection of misinformation and poses a bias to the latest input. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Convolutional Approach for Misinformation Identification (CAMI) based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CAMI can flexibly extract key features scattered among an input sequence and shape high-level interactions among significant features, which help effectively identify misinformation and achieve practical early detection. Experiment results on two large-scale datasets validate the effectiveness of CAMI model on both misinformation identification and early detection tasks.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031897495

A malicious account on OSNs can be created for different objectives such as social spam, identity theft, spear phishing and sybil attacks. In this article, we study and analyze the multiple fake accounts created by one user in order to manipulate and bypass the OSN regulation.

As the biggest Chinese Microblog platform, Sina Weibo not only provides users with a lot of information, but also promotes the diffusion spread of rumors which generated huge negative social impacts. To quickly detect rumors from Sina Weibo, many research works focus on social attributes in social network. However, content play an important role in rumor diffusion, and it was ignored in many research works. In this paper, we use two different text representations, bag of words model and neural network language model, to generate text vectors from rumor contents. Furthermore, we compared performance of two text representations in rumor detection by using some state-of-the-art classification algorithms. From the experiments in 10, 000 Sina Weibo posts, we found that the best classification accuracy of bag of words model is over 90%, and the best classification accuracy of neural network language model is over 60%.

In this context, the risk of running into misinformation is not negligible. For this reason, assessing the credibility of both information and its sources in Social Media platforms constitutes nowadays a fundamental issue for users. In the last years, several approaches have been proposed to address this issue. Most of them employ machine learning techniques to classify information and misinformation. Other approaches exploit multiple kinds of relationships connecting entities in Social Media applications, focusing on credibility and trust propagation. Unlike previous approaches, in this paper we propose a model-driven approach based on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and quantifier guided aggregation. An overall credibility estimate for each piece of information is obtained based on multiple criteria connected to both UGC and users generating it. The proposed model is evaluated in the context of opinion spam detection in review sites, on a real-world dataset crawled from Yelp, and it is compared with well-known supervised machine learning techniques. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Credibility assessment; Multi-criteria decision making; Opinion spam detection; OWA aggregation operators; Social media",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012076998

Nowadays, popular online social sites as Twitter, Facebook and Google+ are among the major news sources as well as the most effective channels for viral marketing. However, these networks also became the most effective channel for spreading misinformation, accidentally or maliciously. The widespread diffusion of inaccurate information or fake news can lead to undesirable and severe consequences, such as widespread panic, libelous campaigns and conspiracies. In order to guarantee the trustworthiness of online social networks it is a crucial challenge to find effective strategies to contrast the spread of the misinformation in the network. In this paper we concentrate our attention on two problems related to the diffusion of misinformation in social networks: identify the misinformation sources and limit its diffusion in the network. We consider a social network where some nodes have already been infected from misinformation. We first provide an heuristics to recognize the set of most probable sources of the infection. Then, we provide an heuristics to place a few monitors in some network nodes in order to control information diffused by the suspected nodes and block misinformation they injected in the network before it reaches a large part of the network. To verify the quality and efficiency of our suggested solutions, we conduct experiments on several real-world networks. Empirical results indicate that our heuristics are among the most effective known in literature. © Copyright 2017, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

A node subset K is an SRS of G if all detectable node sets are distinguishable by K. The problem of multiple rumor source detection (MRSD) in the network can be modeled as finding an SRS K with the smallest cardinality. In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time greedy algorithm for finding a minimum SRS in a general network, achieving performance ratio O(ln n). This is the first work establishing a relation between the MRSD problem and a deterministic concept of SRS, and a first work to give the minimum SRS problem a polynomial-time performance-guaranteed approximation algorithm.

This is regardless of the fact that whether the news is regarding a parliamentary election, or a famous entertainment celebrity. Moreover, these platforms allow people to like, retweet and comment on the shared news article. This shapes the opinions and beliefs of the people who read it along with the news article itself. However, a major problem we face today is the misuse of these networks for spreading rumors and misleading news content. This is the practice of yellow journalism which aims at disrupting public sentiment. To address this problem, we present a methodology to find credible and relevant tweets that refer to actual news articles published on news websites. Our methodology scores each tweet based on the reputation of the users sharing it, the news publisher which published the news article, and the popularity of the news concepts mentioned in the article. We model the interaction between these three entities in the form of a tripartite graph and propose a Co-HITS algorithm based formulation to score all the entities involved. The scores of individual entities is used to assign a score for each tweet that indicates the credibility and relevance of the news mentioned in it. We find that the presence of many bots is also a big problem in these networks and can affect the results of such explorations. Thus, we use existing bot detection techniques to identify bots and propose an approach to limit their influence on the system in an efficient manner.

Thus, the cellular network with underlaying D2D is vulnerable to OSNs as rumors in OSNs may decrement the throughput of the cellular network in popular content delivery scenarios. To analyze the vulnerability, we introduce the problem of finding the most critical nodes in the OSN such that the throughput of a content delivery scenario is minimized when a rumor starts from those nodes.

The numerical results of artificial and empirical networks show that it leads to significant improvement of performance compared to existing approaches. Our analysis sheds insight into the behavior of the disease/rumor spreading process not only in the local particular regime but also for the whole general network. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Complex network; Correlation; Locating source; Observer nodes",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034229553

The robustness of such filters lies in the variety and the quality of the data used to train them. There is, therefore, a need for a tool that automatically generates fake but realistic news. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that automatically generates news headlines. The model is trained with a corpus of existing headlines from different topics. Once trained, the model generates a fake but realistic headline given a seed and a topic. For example, given the seed “Kim Jong Un” and the topic “Business”, the model generates the headline “kim jong un says climate change is already making money”. In order to better capture and leverage the syntactic structure of the headlines for the task of synthetic headline generation, we extend the architecture - Contextual Long Short Term Memory, proposed by Ghosh et al. - to also learn a part-of-speech model. We empirically and comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed model on a real corpora of headlines. We compare our proposed approach and its variants using Long Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units as the building blocks. We evaluate and compare the topical coherence of the generated headlines using a state-of-the-art classifier. We, also, evaluate the quality of the generated headline using a machine translation quality metric and its novelty using a metric we propose for this purpose. We show that the proposed model is practical and competitively efficient and effective. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Deep learning; Natural language generation; Text classification",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028462050

Online Deviant Groups (ODGs) use social media to coordinate cyber propaganda campaigns to achieve strategic and political goals, influence mass thinking, and steer behaviors. In this research, we study the ODGs who conducted cyber propaganda campaigns against NATO’s Trident Juncture Exercise 2015 (TRJE 2015) and how they used Twitter and blogs to drive the campaigns. Using a blended Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Social Cyber Forensics (SCF) approaches, “anti-NATO” narratives were identified on blogs. The narratives intensified as the TRJE 2015 approached. The most influential narrative identified by the proposed methodology called for civil disobedience and direct actions against TRJE 2015 specifically and NATO in general. We use SCF analysis to extract metadata associated with propaganda-riddled websites. The metadata helps in the collection of social and communication network information. By applying SNA on the data, we identify influential users and powerful groups (or, focal structures) coordinating the propaganda campaigns.

Which topics ‘go viral’ and why? How does disinformation spread? How do populations view issues in light of national ‘master narratives’? These are all questions which automated approaches to analyzing social media promise to help answer. We have adapted a technique for multilingual topic modeling to look at differences between what is discussed in Russian versus English. This kills several birds with one stone. We turn the data’s multilinguality from an impediment into a leverageable advantage. But most importantly, we play to unsupervised machine learning’s strengths: its ability to detect large-scale trends, anomalies, similarities and differences, in a highly general way. Applying this approach to different Twitter datasets, we were able to draw out several interesting and non-obvious insights about Russian cyberspace and how it differs from its English counterpart. We show how these insights reveal aspects of how master narratives are instantiated, and how sentiment plays out on a large scale, in Russian discourse relating to NATO. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Information operations; Multilingual; Russia; Topic modelling",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022323266

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how misinformation flows and how user characteristics can shape such flows in the context of a violent riot in Singapore. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply the two-step flow theory and discuss the mixed methods approach involving wrangling Twitter data and descriptive analysis to develop and analyse two corpuses of misinformation related to the riot. Findings: The findings are mostly consistent with the two-step flow theory, in that misinformation flows to the masses from opinion leaders (as indicated by higher measures such as online social influence and followers/following ratio). In the presence of misinformation, tweets opposing such misinformation may not always come from opinion leaders. Practical implications: The authors work furthers knowledge about how misinformation goes viral, which provides practical implications to help policymakers and scholars in understanding and managing the dynamics and pitfalls of misinformation during an emergency.

This study retrieved 8,671,695 MERS-related online documents from May 20 to June 18, 2015, from 171 Korean online channels and analyzed such documents by using multilevel models and data mining with Apriori algorithm association analysis. We used R software (version 3.2.1) for the association analysis data mining and visualization. Buzz with negative emotions (i.e., anxiety or fear) was more prevalent in online discussion boards, Twitter, and online cafes than news sites and blogs. News buzz (b = 0.21, p < 0.001), but not rumor buzz (b = 0.06, p = 0.308), was associated with positive MERS emotions (i.e., being calm or composed). The mention of eating immunity-boosting food in the news led to a 94 percent chance of a positive MERS emotion and that such a chance of showing a positive emotion was 4.75 times higher than that without such a mention (support of 0.001, confidence of 0.94, and lift of 4.75). Even with the same precautionary messages that were disseminated, they yielded the opposite emotional reactions to people depending on the channel through which the messages were communicated. In the face of a novel and highly contagious disease such as MERS, the government must deploy a response system that includes provision and dissemination of reliable information and inhibits online diffusion of false information. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","MERS; Social big data; Social networking",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009445679

The study sought to identify what political information sources young people encounter, how they construe these sources and the messages they communicate, and how the information experiences of young people may be better understood to inform information literacy interventions to support the development of political agency. Design/methodology/approach: Using personal construct theory as a conceptual framework, repertory grid (RG) interviews were used to explore the different ways in which 23 young people aged 14-15 from a town in Northern England conceive of political information and how they evaluate its quality and authority. Findings: The study identified the sources of information young people engage with for finding and receiving what they understand as political information. The results from the RG interviews indicated that young people use a wide range of sources of political information to become informed about politics and the world around them. These sources of information include family, friends, teachers, television news, newspapers, radio shows, comedy shows, social media and community meetings. Participants were aware that they passively encounter information sources as well as actively engage in debate and discussion with other sources. Some participants had difficulty critically evaluating the political information sources they encounter. The nature of young people’s experiences of political information varied greatly. The degree of complexity in the experiences of political information varied not only between participants but was also dependent on their particular relationship with the information sources under scrutiny. Research limitations/implications: The paper has implications for personal construct analysis as a research approach broadly, from the point of view of its use within library and information science research. It is the first study to apply the personal construct approach to the study of young people’s political information use and to consider implications for information literacy support that would have been difficult to access using other approaches. Practical implications: The paper provides insight into an understudied area; that of young people’s conceptions of political information. This insight may be used to inform the improvement of political information provision and information literacy support for young people. Social implications: A deeper understanding of the different ways in which young people identify, engage with and use information for political purposes may contribute to a clearer understanding of young people’s information needs, ideally leading to improved political education and a strengthened democratic process. Originality/value: The paper explores a relatively under-researched area of library and information science research, and does so using a relatively under-used method in the domain. Insights into the perceived characteristics of different sources of political information are novel and contribute to the development of information behaviour and information literacy fields in terms of information for empowerment and democracy. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Civic engagement; Fake news; Information behaviour; Information literacy; Misinformation; Political participation; Young people",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031104377

In this paper, we study the impact of an anti-rumor on the rumor source detection. We first show a negative result: the anti-rumor's diffusion does not increase the detection probability under Maximum-Likelihood-Estimator (MLE) when the number of infected nodes are sufficiently large by passive diffusion that the anti-rumor starts to be spread by a special node, called the protector, after is reached by the rumor. We next consider the case when the distance between the rumor source and the protector follows a certain type of distribution, but its parameter is hidden. Then, we propose the following learning algorithm: a) learn the distance distribution parameters under MLE, and b) detect the rumor source under Maximum-A-Posterior-Estimator (MAPE) based on the learnt parameters. We provide an analytic characterization of the rumor source detection probability for regular trees under the proposed algorithm, where MAPE outperforms MLE by up to 50% for 3-regular trees and by up to 63% when the degree of the regular tree becomes large. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through numerical results, and further present the simulation results for general topologies (e.g., Facebook and US power grid networks) even without knowledge of the distance distribution, showing that under a simple protector placement algorithm, MAPE produces the detection probability much larger than that by MLE. © 2016 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009493996

The post, weblogs, effects or affects human mind, at least for some time. These posts take a part in choosing their decisions and play an important role. But the information present in the post is either information or just misinformation, i.e., just a rumor. People are confused to distinguish these posts in either a correct information or misinformation. It is important to decide whether this is information or just a rumor because it may cause a support of the wrong decision of the whole majority. In this paper, a mathematical framework is presented related to these matters. Firstly, we proposed a mathematical model of news spreading from some posts displayed in an online social network. The development of mathematical models of news propagation uses the epidemiological modeling technique. Then, we proposed criteria of rumor detection and verification for the model. In the case of rumor, a revised model is proposed with media awareness as a control strategy for reducing the rumor spreading. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.","34Dxx; 37Fxx; 91Cxx; 91Dxx",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981225510

Detecting buzz not only provides useful insights into the information propagation mechanism, but also plays an essential role in preventing malicious rumors. However, buzz modeling is a challenging task becauseabuzz time-series often exhibits sudden spikes and heavy tails, wherein most existing time-series models fail. In this article, we propose novel buzz modeling approaches that capture the rise and fade temporal patterns via Product Lifecycle (PLC) model, a classical concept in economics. More specifically, we propose to model multiple peaks in buzz time-series with PLC mixture or PLC group mixture and develop a probabilistic graphical model (K-Mixture of Product Lifecycle (K-MPLC) to automatically discover inherent lifecycle patterns within a collection of buzzes. Furthermore, we effectively utilize the model parameters of PLC mixture or PLC group mixture for burst prediction.

In this work, we focus on users commenting posts published by US Facebook pages supporting scientific and conspiracy-like narratives, and we classify the personality traits of those users according to their online behavior. We show that different and conflicting communities are populated by users showing similar psychological profiles, and that the dominant personality model is the same in both scientific and conspiracy echo chambers.

Damage caused by the spread of rumours is difficult to handle without a full understanding of the dynamics behind it. One of the central steps of understanding rumour spread is to analyze who spread rumours online, why, and how. In this research, we focus on the steps who and why by describing, implementing, and evaluating an approach that studies whether or not a group of users is actively involved in rumour discussions, and assesses rumour-spreading personality types in OSNs. We implement this general approach using Reddit data, and demonstrate its use by determining which users engage with a recurring rumour, and analyzing their comments using qualitative methods. We find that we can reliably classify users into one of three categories: (1) 'Generally support a false rumour', (2) 'Generally refute a false rumour', or (3) 'Generally joke about a false rumour'. Combining text mining techniques, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and social network analysis, we aim to identify and classify those rumour-spreading user categories automatically and provide a more holistic view of rumour spread in OSNs. © 2016 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006782973

Undesirable results caused by misinformation propagation make its timely detection very imperative. An important question is how many monitors are required to detect all misinformation cascades at their early stage. To answer this question, we define a Time Constrained Misinformation Detection (TCMD) problem. As we have proved, there is no polynomial time (1 - ϵ) ln n-approximation for the TCMD problem. The large number of independent misinformation cascades and heterogeneous delays make misinformation detection more challenging. Our approach includes stochastic programming and an O(ln(1 + n)) approximation algorithm for one-hop detection.

Due to the potential harm these false information may bring to the public, false rumor detection has become a significant but challenging research topic. While previous research work mostly views it as a classification task, we treat it as an anomaly detection problem. In this paper, false rumors are viewed as anomalies and we perform Factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD) on our proposed features to detect these anomalies. Two strategies based on Euclidean distance and Cosine similarity are proposed to describe the deviation degree. A rank based on deviation degree is computed which can facilitate further rumor detection.

Social engineering is considered one of the biggest threats to information security nowadays. Social engineering is an attacker technique to manipulate and deceive users in order to access or gain privileged information. Such attacks are continuously developed to deceive a high number of potential victims. The number of social engineering attacks has risen dramatically in the past few years, causing unpleasant damage both to organizations and individuals. Yet little research has discussed social engineering in the virtual environments of social networks. One approach to counter these exploits is through research that aims to understand why people fall victim to such attacks. Previous social engineering and deception research have not satisfactory identified the factors that influence the users' ability to detect attacks. Characteristics that influence users' vulnerability must be investigated to address this issue and help to build a profile for vulnerable users in order to focus on increasing the training programs and education for those users. In this context, the present study proposes a user-centric framework to understand the user's susceptibility, relevant factors and dimensions. © 2016 IEEE.","Deception; Information Security; Phishing; Social Engineering; Social Network",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85004025570

It is often observed that news stories are first broken in Twitter space and then the electronic and print media take them up. However, the distributed structure and lack of moderation in Twitter compounded with the temptation of posting a news worthy story early on Twitter, makes the veracity of information (tweet) a major issue. Our work is an attempt to solve this problem by providing a approach to detect misinformation/rumors on Twitter in real-time automatically. We define a rumor as any information which is circulating in Twitter space and is not in agreement with the information from a credible source. For establishing credibility, our approach is based on the premise that verified News Channel accounts on Twitter would furnish more credible information as compared to the naive unverified account of user (public at large). Our approach has four key steps. Firstly, we extract live streaming tweets corresponding to Twitter trends, identify topics being talked about in each trend based on clustering using hashtags and then collect tweets for each topic. Secondly, we segregate the tweets for each topic based on whether its tweeter is a verified news channel or a general user. Thirdly, we calculate and compare the contextual and sentiment mismatch between tweets comprising of the same topic from verified Twitter accounts of News Channels and other unverified (general) users using semantic and sentiment analysis of the tweets. Lastly, we label the topic as a rumor based on the value of mismatch ratio, which reflects the degree of discrepancy between the news and public on that topic. Results show that a large amount of topics can be flagged as suspicious using this approach without involvement of any manual inspection. In order to validate our proposed algorithm, we implement a prototype called The Twitter Grapevine which targets rumor detection in the Indian domain. The prototype shows how a user can leverage this implementation to monitor the detected rumors using activity timeline, maps and tweet feed. User can also report the rumor as incorrect which can then be updated after manual inspection. © 2016 IEEE.","Misinformation Detection; Trending Rumor; Verified News Channels",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007346013

On 06.12.2014, three teenagers were kidnapped from a bus station in the West Bank and found dead after several days. A gag order was issued, causing interest in alternative sources of information. This study investigated how information spread through WhatsApp during the search operation using a participatory research approach. 13 rumors circulating on WhatsApp were collected, nine of which were verified, and found to be true. A web-based survey revealed that 61.1% of 419 respondents received information regarding the kidnapping through WhatsApp; 38.9% through Facebook. Sources of two rumors and participation of emergency authorities in rumor dissemination were identified. Some rumors originated from the family and community of the abductees, while other WhatsApp messages included information and names of two abductees, which were not public at the time. When emergency authorities share unconfirmed information, it is perceived as more credible than information spread by citizens. During the operation, official representatives did not correct or refute any rumors. Locating the source of a rumor is challenging and thus it is important to actively investigate rumors in real-time in order to locate the source. © 2016 The Authors","Emergency management; Misinformation; Rumor; Social media; Terror; WhatsApp",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977272679

In many applications, finding the most influential nodes in the network is informative for the network analyzers in order to track the spread of information, disease and rumors. The problem of finding the top k influential nodes of a directed graph G=(V,E) such that the influence spread of these nodes will be maximized has long been exposed and many algorithms have been proposed to deal with this problem. Despite the useful characteristics of community structure in social networks, only a few works have studied the role of communities in the spread of influence in social networks. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm (which has an acceptable response time even for large graphs) for finding the influential nodes in the graph under linear threshold model. We exploit the community structure of graph to find the influential communities, and then find the influence of each node as a combination of its local and global influences. We compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art methods for influence maximization problem and the results of our experiments on real world datasets show that our approach outperforms the other ones in the quality of outputted influential nodes while still has acceptable running time and memory usage for large graphs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Community detection; Influence maximization; Influence spread; Linear threshold model; Social network",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969930005

People share a huge amount of information on social media, thus increasing the amount of information at a very fast rate. This has made Social Data Analytics an important area of research. Analyzing the opinions or sentiments of people on the data shared can serve as a great means for making decisions in various domains. Also, not each and every data present on social media is correct as various people try to spread rumors, mostly just for fun. Due to this, it is required that there exist methods using which people can easily check information credibility of data concerning social media. The research carried out till now have mainly focused on tracking and modeling sentiments of public. This paper proposes a method for assessing the credibility of information by emulating the methods of topic and opinion classifications, primarily focusing on Twitter data. Improved Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm has been used for classification of topics within the tweets and semi-supervised method (SVM) has been used for sentiment analysis. Finally, majority decision by comparing the number of contrastive opinions about a topic is performed, for credibility analysis. Though, English and Hinglish languages have been used here, however, this method can be adapted easily to other languages since Twitter API allows specifying the language of the retrieved posts. © 2016 IEEE.","Contrastive opinions; Information Credibility; Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Sentiment Analysis; Social Data Analytics; Twitter",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84997077894

Identifying the most influential spreaders in a network is a significant step towards improving the use of existing resources to speed up the spread of information for application such as viral marketing or hindering the spread of information for application like virus blocking and rumor restraint. Users communications facilitated by OSNs could confront the temporal and spatial limitations of traditional communications in an exceptional way, thereby presenting new layers of social interactions, which coincides and collaborates with current interaction layers to redefine the multiplex OSN. In this paper, the effects of different topological network structure on influential spreaders identification are investigated. The results analysis concluded that improving the accuracy of influential spreaders identification in OSNs is not only by improving identification algorithms but also by developing a network topology that represents the information diffusion well. Moreover, in this paper a topological representation for an OSN is proposed which takes into accounts both multilayers interactions as well as overlaying links as weight. The measurement results are found to be more reliable when the identification algorithms are applied to proposed topological representation compared when these algorithms are applied to single layer representations. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

The model outputs are first studied through a functional analysis in which some unique macroscopic behaviors have emerged such as the impact of social groups, the resistance of the population toward disinformation campaigns or the social pressure. We then applied our model on a real world scenario depicting the effort of French Forces in their stabilization operations in Kapisa (Afghanistan) between 2010 and 2012. We calibrated the model parameters based on this scenario and the results of opinion polls that were conducted in the area during the same period about the sentiment of the population toward the Forces.

Based on the theory of Barbalat's lemma, some control inputs and updating laws are designed so that nodes in the auxiliary layer reaches complete synchronization with their counterparts in the response layer and the unknown topology of the response layer can be adaptively identified, meanwhile, the drive layer and the response layer achieve generalized synchronization. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In each round every node contacts a random neighbor in order to exchange the rumor (i.e., either push the rumor to its neighbor or pull it from the neighbor). A natural asynchronous variant of this algorithm is one where each node has an independent Poisson clock with rate 1, and every node contacts a random neighbor whenever its clock ticks. This asynchronous variant is arguably a more realistic model in various settings, including message broadcasting in communication networks, and information dissemination in social networks. In this paper we study how asynchrony affects the rumor spreading time, that is, the time before a rumor originated at a single node spreads to all nodes in the graph. Our first result states that the asynchronous push-pull rumor spreading time is asymptotically bounded by the standard synchronous time. Precisely, we show that for any graph G on n-nodes, where the synchronous push-pull protocol informs all nodes within T(G) rounds with high probability, the asynchronous protocol needs at most time O(T(G) + log n) to inform all nodes with high probability. On the other hand, we show that the expected synchronous pushpull rumor spreading time is bounded by O(√n) times the expected asynchronous time. These results improve upon the bounds for both directions shown recently by Acan et al. (PODC 2015). An interesting implication of our first result is that in regular graphs, the weaker push-only variant of synchronous rumor spreading has the same asymptotic performance as the synchronous push-pull algorithm. © 2016 ACM.","Asynchronous vs synchronous models; Push/pull; Randomized rumor spreading",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984700616

For example, social networks spread rumors as well as useful information. Computer networks can spread Internet worms or malicious packets. In many cases, it is very hard to find the root cause (a.k.a. initial rumor spreader) of such errors without complete knowledge of the error propagation. We aim to find the root cause node when there is limited information about error propagation. We assume that there are very small number of monitor nodes in the network reporting whether error reached them or not. With this assumption, we first propose an algorithm that finds the most probable root cause node. Second, to improve the accuracy of root cause analysis, we propose another algorithm that makes use of timestamp of error reception. Finally, we study how to select monitors effectively so that root cause analysis can be accurate. With real networks from various domains, our algorithms are shown to be very effective.

As a tradeoff, normal human interactions are inevitably degraded by the quarantine.

With the rapid development of mobile communication equipments, traditional rumor propagation models, which depend on ordinary differential equations (ODE), may not be suitable for describing rumor propagation in an online social network. In this paper, based on reaction-diffusion equations, we propose a novel epidemic-like model with both discrete and nonlocal delays for investigating the spatialoral dynamics of rumor propagation. By analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations of this model, the local stability conditions of a boundary equilibrium point and a positive equilibrium point are established. By applying the linear approximation method of nonlinear systems, sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of Hopf bifurcation at the above two kinds of equilibrium points. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis method based on the density of spreading users is proposed, and then in theoretical and experimental aspect we identify some sensitive parameters in the process of rumor propagation.

Messages in these applications propagate anonymously (without authorship metadata) over a network that is typically defined by social connections or physical proximity. However, recent advances in rumor source detection show that the source of such an anonymous message can be inferred by statistical inference attacks. Adaptive diffusion was recently proposed as a solution that achieves optimal source obfuscation over regular trees. However, in real social networks, node degrees different from node to node, and adaptive diffusion can be significantly sub-optimal. This gap increases as the degrees become more irregular. In order to quantify this gap, we model the underlying network as coming from standard branching processes with i.i.d. degree distributions. Building upon the analysis techniques from branching processes, we give an analytical characterization of the dependence between the probability of detection achieved by adaptive diffusion and the degree distribution. Further, this analysis provides a key insight: passing a rumor to a friend who has many friends makes the source more ambiguous. This leads to a new family of protocols that we call Preferential Attachment Adaptive Diffusion (PAAD). When messages are propagated according to PAAD, we give both the MAP estimator for finding the source and also an analysis of the probability of detection achieved by this adversary. The analytical results are not directly comparable, since the adversary's observed information has a different distribution under adaptive diffusion than under PAAD. Instead, we present results from numerical experiments that suggest that PAAD achieves a lower probability of detection, at the cost of increased communication for coordination. © 2016 ACM.","Anonymous social media; Privacy; Rumor spreading",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978630472

Accordingly, identifying false information, e.g., rumors circulated in social media environments, attracts expanding research attention and growing interests. Many previous studies have exploited user-independent features for rumor detection. These prior investigations uniformly treat all users relevant to the propagation of a social media message as instances of a generic entity. Such a modeling approach usually adopts a homogeneous network to represent all users, the practice of which ignores the variety across an entire user population in a social media environment. Recognizing this limitation in modeling methodologies, this paper explores user-specific features in a social media environment for rumor detection. The new approach hypothesizes whether a user tending to spread a rumor message is dependent on specific attributes of the user in addition to content characteristics of the message itself. Under this hypothesis, the information propagation patterns of rumors versus those of credible messages in a social media environment are differentiable. To explore and exploit this hypothesis, we develop a new information propagation model based on a heterogeneous user representation and modeling approach. By applying the new approach, we are able to differentiate rumors from credible messages through observing distinctions in their respective propagation patterns in social media. The experimental results show that the new information propagation model based on heterogeneous user representation can effectively distinguish rumors from credible social media content. Our experimental findings further show that rumors are more likely to spread among certain user groups. ï¿½ 2014 IEEE.","Heterogeneous user representation and modeling; Information credibility in social media; Information propagation model; Rumor detection",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991107284

Typically, these bots or spam accounts are automated programmatically using the social media site's API and attempt to convey or spread a particular message. Some bots are designed for marketers trying to sell products or attract users to new sites. Other types of bots are much more malicious and disseminate misinformation that harms or tricks users. Such bots (fake accounts) may lead to serious consequences, as people's social network has become one of the determining factors in their general decision makin'. Therefore, these accounts have the potential to influence peoples opinions drastically and hence real life events as well.

This research paradigm allows modeling a virtual market to: design, understand, and evaluate marketing hypotheses before taking them to the real world. However, there are shortcomings in the specialized literature such as the lack of methods, data, and implemented tools to deploy a realistic virtual market with ABSS. To advance the state of the art in this complex and interesting problem, this paper is a seven-fold contribution based on a (1) method to design and validate viral marketing strategies in Twitter by ABSS. The method is illustrated with the widely studied problem of rumor diffusion in social networks. After (2) an extensive review of the related works for this problem, (3) an innovative spread model is proposed which rests on the exploratory data analysis of two different rumor datasets in Twitter. Besides, (4) new strategies are proposed to control malicious gossips. (5) The experimental results validate the realism of this new propagation model with the datasets and (6) the strategies performance is evaluated over this model. (7) Finally, the article is complemented by a free and open-source simulator. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous works mainly focus on using social attribute features in rumor analysis. However, social attribute features don't indicate the purpose of a rumor which is one of the most important aspects of a rumor. To solve that problem, we focus on not only those social attribute features, but also social content features to find out what kind of features are useful for exploring the purpose of a rumor. Finally, we propose 6 kinds of features, where four of them belong to social attribute features and two of them belong to social content features. To uncover the purpose of rumors from proposed features, we choose Sina weibo, the biggest micro-blog platform in China, and crawl 11,676 rumors for analysis. The analysis results show that the diffusion purpose of rumors can be concluded from social content attributes, and proposed two layers KL divergence approach is useful in diffusion purpose words perception. © 2015 IEEE.","content attribute; diffusion purpose; Rumor feature; social attribute; social media",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969959907

However, they also make it possible for rapid and wide misinformation diffusion, which may lead to pernicious influences on individuals or society. Hence, it is extremely important and necessary to detect the misinformation propagation by placing monitors. In this article, we first define a general misinformation-detection problem for the case where the knowledge about misinformation sources is lacking, and show its equivalence to the influence-maximization problem in the reverse graph. Furthermore, considering node vulnerability, we aim to detect the misinformation reaching to a specific user. Therefore, we study a τ-Monitor Placement problem for cases where partial knowledge of misinformation sources is available and prove its #P complexity.We formulate a corresponding integer program, tackle exponential constraints, and propose a Minimum Monitor Set Construction (MMSC) algorithm, in which the cut-set2 has been exploited in the estimation of reachability of node pairs. Moreover, we generalize the problem from a single target tomultiple central nodes and propose another algorithm based on a Monte Carlo sampling technique.

However, it is also one of the main ways of misinformation transmission, due to the lack of an effective scheme for detection and countermeasures. Existing methods mainly detect misinformation based on classification algorithms. They can't identify the popular misinformation early. In order to reduce the harmfulness of misinformation and make microblog more user-friendly, in this paper a new method is presented for detecting misinformation based on gatekeepers' behaviors. In the proposed scheme, hidden semi-Markov model is used to describe the behaviors of the forwarders and reviewers of popularly true information. Gamma distribution is introduced to describe the state duration of the model. The proposed method includes a training phase and a detection phase. In the detection phase, the average log likelihood of every observation sequence is calculated, and the credibility value of information is updated in real time. So this method can identify the popular misinformation early and reduce the harmfulness of misinformation. An experiment based on real datasets of Sina Weibo and Twitter is conducted to evaluate this method. The experiment results validate the effectiveness of this method. © 2016, Science Press.

Thus, tweets form an integral part of big data ecosystem. While this platform serves as an efficient information diffusion medium, it can also be used to spread misinformation intentionally or unintentionally, which can damage the reputation of an individual or a corporation. Misinformation could also be harmful to society in general. As veracity in big data gains more attention, it is also important to develop methods to estimate veracity of tweets. There are no definitive measures to determine the veracity of tweets from tweets themselves. Other information that are required to verify tweets may not be readily available. Hence, there is a need for such mechanisms to determine the level of accuracy of tweets from available data. In this paper we propose three quantitative measures we name as topic diffusion, geographic dispersion, and spam index as indicators of veracity of tweets. These measures are derived from tweets themselves independent of any corroborating data. The proposed measures are tested using tweets about oil companies as validators. To validate the proposed measures, information extracted from tweets are compared with information collected from official data sources. Our experiments show that the proposed measures were able to estimate the level of veracity among tweets in most topics we tested. We also found the measures useful to compare the veracity of different topics as points in a 3-dimensional space. Another application of veracity indices to positions of political candidates is also described. © 2016 IEEE.","geographic dispersion; micro-blog; misinformation; reputation; spam rate; topic diffusion; Twitter; veracity",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964681157

Experiment results show that our emerging rumor identification for social media with hot topic detection work well both in news data set and twitter data set, and combining the hot topic detection with the rumor detection is possible to finish real-time rumor identification. We believe our method to automatically detect rumor will open new dimensions in analyzing online misinformation and other aspects of social media mining. © 2015 IEEE.","Bursty term; Hot topic detection; Rumor identification; Sentence modeling; Social media",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964292765

The credibility is assessed by calculating the ratio of the same opinions to all opinions about a topic identified by topic models generated using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. To identify an opinion (positive or negative) expressed in a tweet, a sentiment analysis is performed using a semantic orientation dictionary. However, the accuracy is a problem to identify the few false tweets. The accuracy of the originally proposed method was susceptible since the sentiment opinion of most tweets was identified negative by the baseline (namely Takamura's) semantic orientation dictionary. Furthermore, specialty namely expertise of users was not considered. To cope with these problems, a method for extracting sentiment orientations of words and phrases was proposed considering user's specialty / expertise degree or mark to each of the same / opposite opinion tweets. The effects of both improvements are proven by experiments using a large number of real tweets. Namely, in these experiments rum or tweets were detected more accurately. © 2015 IEEE.","expertise degree; semantic orientation dictionary; sentiment analysis; topic classification; tweet credibility analysis",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964460050

However, the spread of groundless rumor information was big social problem. Therefore, social media users pay attention to prevent wrong information from diffusing. The way to stop the spread of a false rumor is needed, so we have to understand a diffusion of information mechanism. We have proposed information diffusion model which is based on SIR model until now. This model is represented by the stochastic state transition model for whether to propagate the information, and its transition probability is defined as the same value for all agents. People ’s thinking or actions are not the same. To solve this problem, we adopted three elements in our model: A new internal state switching model, user diversity and multiplexing of information paths. In this paper, we propose a novel information diffusion model, the Agent-based Information Diffusion Model (AIDM). We reproduce two kinds of false rumor information diffusion using proposed model. One is “single burst type false rumor spread ”, and another is “multi burst type false rumor spread. ”Proposal model is estimated by comparing real data with a simulation result. © 2016, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

Rumors bring significant harm to daily life and public security. It is crucial to evaluate the credibility of information and detect the rumors on social media automatically. In this work, we establish a Network Information Credibility Evaluation (NICE) platform, which collects a database of rumors that have been verified on SinaWeibo and automatically evaluates the information which is generated by users on social media but has not been verified. Users can use a query to search related information. If the according information appears in our database, users can identify it is a rumor immediately. Otherwise, NICE will show users with realtime results crawled automatically from social media and can calculate credibility of a specific result with our algorithm. Our algorithm learns dynamic representations for information on social media based on behavior information, dynamic information, user information and comment information. Then, we use an ordinary logistic regression to classify information into rumors and non-rumors. Based on our algorithm, NICE system achieves satisfactory performance on evaluating information credibility and detecting rumors on social media. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

In this article, we aim to support the task of making sense from social media data, and specifically, seek to build an autonomous message-classifier that filters relevant and trustworthy information from Twitter. For our work, we collected about 100 million public tweets, including users’ past tweets, from which we identified 72 rumours (41 true, 31 false). We considered over 80 trustworthiness measures including the authors’ profile and past behaviour, the social network connections (graphs), and the content of tweets themselves. We ran modern machine-learning classifiers over those measures to produce trustworthiness scores at various time windows from the outbreak of the rumour. Such time-windows were key as they allowed useful insight into the progression of the rumours. From our findings, we identified that our model was significantly more accurate than similar studies in the literature. We also identified critical attributes of the data that give rise to the trustworthiness scores assigned.

Over the years, online social media (OSN) have evolved widely, converting part of our personal lives to virtual ones. But this evolution also has negative effects. In 2012, 16.6 million of Americans were victims of identity theft according to an estimate from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, with up to $24.7 billion of financial losses for these victims. Various techniques are used to manipulate users in OSN environments such as social spam, identity theft, spear phishing and Sybil attacks... In this article, we are interested in analyzing the behavior of multiple fake accounts that try to bypass the OSN regulation. In the context of social media manipulation detection, we focus on the special case of multiple Identity accounts (Sockpuppet) created on English Wikipedia (EnWiki). We set up a complete methodology spanning from the data extraction from EnWiki to the training and testing of our selected data using several machine learning algorithms.

In this paper, we analyzed actual data of malicious accounts and extracted features. Based on this results, we detect the suspected accounts that spread rumors. Firstly, we crawled actual data and analyzed feature. And we selected feature as three approaches and added a new feature as propagation approach by existing work. That is user can re-tweet influencer’s tweet and edit it. We discussed it by ratio for RT. After that, we selected classification standard using average of data based on selected feature and trained it. Bayesian network is used for training.

This task is referred to as truth discovery which aims at identifying the reliability of the sources and the truthfulness of claims they make without knowing either of them a priori. There are two important challenges that have not been well addressed in current truth discovery solutions. The first one is 'misinformation spread' where a majority of sources are contributing to false claims, making the identification of truthful claims difficult. The second challenge is 'data sparsity' where sources contribute a small number of claims, providing insufficient evidence to accomplish the truth discovery task. In this paper, we developed a Robust Truth Discovery (RTD) scheme to address the above two challenges. In particular, the RTD scheme explicitly quantifies different degrees of attitude that a source may express on a claim and incorporates the historical contributions of a source using a principled approach. The evaluation results on two real world datasetsshow that the RTD scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art truth discovery methods. © 2016 IEEE.","Big Data; Rumor Robust; Sparse Social Sensing; Truth Discovery; Twitter",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015242462

Any method of studying the sampled data is also prone to bias. Sampling and bias aside the data may be generated with malicious intent, such as deception. Deception is a complicated (broad, situational, vague) concept. It seems improbable that an automated computer system would be able to find deception as such. Instead, we argue that the role of a system would be to aid the human analyst by detecting indicators, or clues, of (potential) deception. Indicators could take many forms and are typically neither necessary nor sufficient for there to be an actual deception. However, by using one or combining several of them a human may reach conclusions. Indicators are not necessarily dependent and will be added to or removed from the analysis depending on the circumstances. This modularity can help in counteracting/alleviating attacks on the system by an adversary.

In the past years, Twitter has come under scrutiny due to its lack of filtering mechanisms, which lead to the propagation of trolling, bullying, and other unsocial behaviors. Rumors can also be easily created on Twitter, e.g., by extreme political campaigners, and widely spread by readers who cannot judge their truthfulness. Current work on Twitter message assessment, however, focuses on credibility, which is subjective and can be affected by assessor’s bias. In this paper, we focus on the actual message truthfulness, and propose a rule-based method for detecting political rumors on Twitter based on identifying extreme users. We employ clustering methods to identify news tweets. In contrast with other methods that focus on the content of tweets, our unsupervised classification method employs five structural and timeline features for the detection of extreme users.

Based on the theory of complex networks, we simulate the complex process of rumor spreading in OSN. Using numerical simulations with focus on the information spreading threshold as well as critical behaviors, we study the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered- Susceptible (SIRS) information dynamics model in OSN with asymmetric propagation. Basic principle and structure of OSN were analyzed. We present a rumor spreading model, where the influence of the neighbor trees is treated in a more realistic way and the definition of a neighborhood can be tuned by an additional parameter. Based on the mean-field theory approach, a contact network model with scale-free property is built. It is demonstrated that the asymmetry of propagation plays important role: We could redistribute the asymmetry to balance the degree heterogeneity of the network and then to restore the information threshold to a finite value. The relationship of spreading probability, network size, infected fraction and infected ratio are showed respectively in the paper. Our model exhibits a surprisingly sharp phase transition which can be shifted by a redefinition of the neighborhood. The result shows that the SIRS model built in this paper is valid and the simulation of the information propagation is feasible. © 2016 SERSC.","Epidemic threshold; Mean-field theory; Online social networks; Phase transition",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962082566

Besides revealing information about social interactions between individuals, MSNs can assist smart city applications through crowdsensing services. In presence of malicious users who aim at misinformation through manipulation of their sensing data, trustworthiness arises as a crucial issue for the users who receive service from smart city applications. In this paper, the authors propose a new crowdsensing framework, namely Social Network Assisted Trustworthiness Assurance (SONATA) which aims at maximizing crowdsensing platform utility and minimizing the manipulation probability through vote-based trustworthiness analysis in dynamic social network architecture. SONATA adopts existing Sybil detection techniques to identify malicious users who aim at misinformation/disinformation at the crowdsensing platform. The authors present performance evaluation of SONATA under various crowdsensing scenarios in a smart city setting. Performance results show that SONATA improves crowdsensing utility under light and moderate arrival rates of sensing task requests when less than 7% of the users are malicious whereas crowdsensing utility is significantly improved under all task arrival rates if the ratio of malicious users to the entire population is at least 7%. Furthermore, under each scenario, manipulation ratio is close to zero under SONATA while trustworthiness unaware recruitment of social network users leads to a manipulation probability of 2.5% which cannot be tolerated in critical smart city applications such as disaster management or public safety.

Microblogs – a type of social media application such as Twitter or Weibo – have served as an important platform for network governance in some local governments in China. This study makes an attempt to answer the following questions: What types of strategies should governments implement on social media platforms during public emergencies? What are the effects of these strategies? Based on the case of the Shifang Incident, which was a large-scale environmental protest that occurred in Shifang, China in 2012, we analyze all the messages posted during the incident on the officialmicroblog of the Shifang government and examine the public feedback by using an online big data analysis tool. In line with the time sequence and the extent of the conflict, we divide the Shifang Incident into three phases: the fermentation period, the confrontation period, and the digestion period. In addition, we classify government strategies on social media into five categories: introducing, appealing, explaining, rumor-refuting, and decisionmaking. The analysis results show that different government strategies are applied to different phases of the incident and that the responses of the public also vary during different periods. © Institute of Information Management, University of St. Gallen 2015.","Big data; Governance strategies; Mass incidents; Microblog; Public emergency; Social media",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978602950

We address this question in a setting where multiple agents seek an estimate of the probability, b, of some future binary event. A common uniform prior on b is assumed. A rumor about b meanders through the network, evolving over time. The rumor evolves, not because of ill will or noise, but because agents incorporate private signals about b before passing on the (modified) rumor. The loss to an agent is the (realized) square error of her opinion. Our setting introduces strategic behavior based on evidence regarding an exogenous event to current models of rumor/influence propagation in social networks. We study a simple Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for combining experience evidence and trusted advice (rumor), quantifying its resulting performance and comparing it to the optimal achievable using Bayes posterior having access to the agents private signals. We study the quality of pT, the prediction of the last agent along a chain of T rumor-mongering agents. The prediction pT can be viewed as an aggregate estimator of b that depends on the private signals of T agents. We show that – When agents know their position in the rumor-mongering sequence, the expected mean square error of the aggregate estimator is Θ(1/T). Moreover, with probability 1−δ, the aggregate estimator’s deviation from b is Θ(√ln(1/δ)/T). – If the position information is not available, and agents act strategically, the aggregate estimator has a mean square error of O(1/√T). Furthermore, with probability 1 − δ, the aggregate estimator’s deviation from b is Õ (√ln(1/δ)/√T). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988008205

Inevitably, these services are also used to spread false rumors and misinformation, usually with the unintentional collaboration from innocent users. Previous studies show that microblog information credibility can be assessed automatically based on the features extracted from message contents and users. In this paper, we address this problem from a new perspective by exploring the human input in the propagation process of popular microblog posts. Specifically, we consider that the users are the gatekeepers of their own media portal on microblogging sites, as they decide which information is filtered for dissemination to their followers. We find that truthful posts and false rumors exhibit distinguishable patterns in terms of which gatekeepers forward them and what the gatekeepers comment on them. Based on this finding, we propose to assess the information credibility of popular microblog posts with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) of gatekeeping behavior. The proposed approach is evaluated using a real life data set that consists of over ten thousand popular posts collected from Sina Weibo. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","HMM; Information credibility; Microblogging; Online social networks; Weibo",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989875919

Posts shared by users pertaining to real-world events or themes can provide a rich ""on-theground"" live update of the events for the benefit of everyone. Unfortunately, the posted information may not be all credible and rumours can spread over this platform. Existing credibility assessment work have focused on identifying features for discriminating the credibility of messages at the tweet level. However, they do not handle tweets that contain multiple pieces of information, each of which may have different level of credibility. In this work, we introduce the notion of a claim based on subject and predicate terms, and propose a framework to identify claims from a corpus of tweets related to some major event or theme. Specifically, we draw upon work done in open information extraction to extract from tweets, tuples that comprises of subjects and their predicate. Then we cluster these tuples to identify claims such that each claim refers to only one aspect of the event. Tweets corresponding to the tuples in each cluster serve as evidence supporting subsequent credibility assessment task. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying claims.

In particular, the availability of large-scale data from social networks and sensor networks offers an unprecedented opportunity to predict state-changing events at the individual level. Examples of such events include disease transmission, opinion transition in elections, and rumor propagation. Unlike previous research focusing on the collective effects of social systems, this study makes efficient inferences at the individual level. In order to cope with dynamic interactions among a large number of individuals, we introduce the stochastic kinetic model to capture adaptive transition probabilities and propose an efficient variational inference algorithm the complexity of which grows linearly - rather than exponentially-with the number of individuals. To validate this method, we have performed epidemic-dynamics experiments on wireless sensor network data collected from more than ten thousand people over three years. The proposed algorithm was used to track disease transmission and predict the probability of infection for each individual.

We propose new diffusion models that incorporate the time-decaying phenomenon by which the power of influence decreases with elapsed time. In standard diffusion models such as the independent cascade and linear threshold models, each edge in a network has a fixed power of influence over time. However, in practical settings, such as rumor spreading, it is natural for the power of influence to depend on the time influenced. We generalize the independent cascade and linear threshold models with time-decaying effects. Moreover, we show that by using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within (1 − 1/e) of optimal. In addition, we propose theoretically and practically fast algorithms for the proposed models.

Each piece of information appears in some nodes and spreads node by node over the underlying network. So, inferring network structures and analyzing information diffusion processes are required in various domains. In most cases the underlying network is hidden and we only observe the times in which nodes are infected by contagions. The vast majority of existing methods are parametric with the assumption that information diffusion patterns follow a particular distribution. In this paper, to tackle this problem, we propose a simple and non-parametric method that infers the networks topology given a set of cascades. We consider that there exists an unobserved network and we just observe the temporal diffusion events that occur over the edges of the network. First we extract all candidates edges in the network and after that we estimate weights and strength of these edges. In other words, we calculate the occurrence probability between each pair of nodes in all given cascades which is the pairwise transmission rate between that two nodes. The most dominant feature of our approach is having a very low time and computational complexity compared to the current approaches. In addition, as have not considered any assumptions on the information diffusion pattern, our proposed approach has the advantage of being more general and it can be used in various inferring network problems. In summary, experimental results show that not only our method can reach better or equal performance in comparison with baseline models but also it solves the problem in a simpler way with low time complexity. © 2015 IEEE.","Inferring Network Structure; Information Cascades; Information Diffusion; Social networks",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964515064

In this paper, we explore the exploitation of social media for CRM, and describe the development and functionality of VIZIE - a social media monitoring system designed to help media monitors to distill the perception of potential and actual customers of the value of existing products and services, identify and correct customer misinformation, discover how to better meeting customer expectations, and (if needed) communicate directly with the customers by using the customers' preferred social media forum. VIZIE monitors the most popular social media networks and mines their content in real time independently of topical domain and social media source/type. VIZIE achieves these by integrating information from multiple social media sources to create a broader, more complete context compared individual social media posting about specific topics of interest to a VIZIE user. VIZIE also provides the ability to automatically create overviews and summaries of any such topic, permits user queries, and supports drill down to individual social media posting. VIZIE accomplishes these by using a variety of natural language processing and information retrieval techniques that are specifically selected for (or tailored to deliver) real-time responsiveness.

Designing effective strategies for influence spread maximization, rumor spread minimization, or epidemic immunization has attracted considerable research attention. However, a key challenge is that many times we can only observe the trace of contagion spreading across network, but the underlying network structure is unknown and the transmission rates between node pairs are unclear to us. In this paper, given the observed information cascades, we aim to address two problems: diffusion network structure inferring and information diffusion pathways tracking. We propose a novel probabilistic model called Network Inferring from Multidimensional Features of Cascades (NIMFC) which takes into account heterogeneous features, including temporal and topological features of cascades, node attributes, and information content, to infer the latent network structure and transmission rates of edges. Also, based on the inferred network structure, we may track diffusion pathways of a cascade in social networks. We use blocked coordinate descent method to learn a sparse estimation of the latent network. Our proposed model NIMFC is evaluated both on large synthetic and real-world data sets, and experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models both in terms of recovering the latent network structure and information pathway tracking. © 2015, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","diffusion network; information cascades; information pathway tracking; network inferring; node attributes; temporal feature; topological feature",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939268543

The credibility is assessed by calculating the ratio of the same opinions to all opinions about a topic identified by topic models generated using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. To identify an opinion (positive or negative) about a tweet, sentiment analysis is performed using a semantic orientation dictionary. However, it is a kind of imbalanced data analysis to identify usually very few false tweets and the accuracy is a problem. The accuracy of the originally proposed method was susceptible since the sentiment opinion of most tweets was identified negative by the baseline (namely Takamura's) semantic orientation dictionary. To cope with this problem, a method for extracting sentiment orientations of words and phrases is also proposed to improve the evaluation for analyzing the credibility of tweet information. This method 1) evolutionally learns from a large amount of social data on Twitter, 2) focuses on adjective predicates, and 3) considers co-occurrences with negation expressions or multiple adjectives, between subjects and predicates, etc. The effects are proven by experiments using a large number of real tweets, in which we could detect rumor tweet much more accurately. In opposition to the baseline semantic dictionary, our method leads to succeed in imbalanced data analysis. © 2015 IEEE.","evolutional learn by tweet; imbalanced data analysis; semantic orientation dictionary; sentiment analysis; topic classification; tweet credibility",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963620219

However, we recently have observed that various malicious information, such as computer virus and rumors, were broadly spread via social networks. For better controlling the spread of malicious information, it is critical to develop effective methods to locate the diffusion source nodes in social networks. Many pioneer works have explored the source locating problem, but they mostly rely on the assumption that there is only a single source node. In this paper, we present an approximate multi-source locating algorithm by first introducing a new reverse propagation model to detect the recovered and unobserved infected nodes, and then developing a community detection method to cluster the extended infected nodes (including recovered nodes and infected nodes) into multiple infected communities. In doing so, we can identify the source nodes by using the maximum likelihood estimation on each infected community.

The first strategy is formulated as the inverse of seeding influential users to achieve maximal content spread. Activity-based centrality computation is explored as the strategy to target context-dependent influential nodes whose messages are probabilistically dropped. The second strategy makes use of a softer approach in which specific agents designated to counter the rumors do so by spreading anti-rumor messages.

On the other hand, the network administrator aims to identify the source node based on knowledge of which nodes have accepted the rumor (which are called infected nodes). We model the rumor spreading and source identification problem as a strategic game, where the rumor source and the network administrator are the two players. As the Jordan center estimator is a minimax source estimator that has been shown to be robust in recent works, we assume that the network administrator utilizes a source estimation strategy that probes every node within a given radius of the Jordan center. Given any estimation strategy, we design a best-response infection strategy for the rumor source. Given any infection strategy, we design a best-response estimation strategy for the network administrator. We derive conditions under which the Nash equilibria of the strategic game exist. Simulations in both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed infection strategy infects more nodes while maintaining the same safety margin between the true source node and the Jordan center source estimator. © 2015 ACM.","Jordan center; Rumor source; Rumor spreading; Social network; Source identification",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962601901

Consequently, there is an increasing need to improve understanding of the social and technological processes behind this trend. The first step in detecting rumours is to identify and extract memes, a unit of information that can be spread from person to person in OSNs. This paper proposes four similarity scores and two novel strategies to combine those similarity scores for detecting the spread of memes in OSNs, with the end goal of helping researchers as well as members of various OSNs to study the phenomenon. The two proposed strategies include: (1) automatically computing the similarity score weighting factors for four elements of a submission and (2) allowing users to engage in the clustering process and filter out outlier submissions, modify submission class labels, or assign different similarity score weight factors for various elements of a submission using a visualization prototype. To validate our approach, we collect submissions on Reddit about five controversial topics and demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform the baseline. © 2015 ACM.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962559185

We show that the problem is NP-hard. Moreover, we show that the function that calculates the probability of achieving the coverage threshold is not submodular, and hence conventional optimization techniques based on the submodularity property cannot be applied directly. Nevertheless, we present an algorithm that can provably approximate the size of the optimal seed set. In addition, we present a Monte-Carlo algorithm for choosing the best node that generates the greatest marginal increment in expected coverage. We compare the size of seed set with other baseline algorithms by using both real and synthetic networks. Our algorithm consistently outperforms other methods.

For tree networks, multiple independent observations can dramatically improve the detection probability. For the case of a single rumor source, we propose a unified inference framework based on the joint rumor centrality, and provide explicit detection performance for degree-regular tree networks. Surprisingly, even with merely two observations, the detection probability at least doubles that of a single observation, and further approaches one, i.e., reliable detection, with increasing degree. This indicates that a richer diversity enhances detectability. Furthermore, we consider the case of multiple connected sources and investigate the effect of diversity. For general graphs, a detection algorithm using a breadth-first search strategy is also proposed and evaluated. Besides rumor source detection, our results can be used in network forensics to combat recurring epidemic-like information spreading such as online anomaly and fraudulent email spams. © 2015 IEEE.","Graph networks; inference algorithms; maximum likelihood detection; multiple observations; rumor spreading",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929301086

Most analysis tools, however, start from the premises that models are fully specified, so that any parameters controlling the system's dynamics must be known exactly. As this is seldom the case, many methods have been devised over the last decade to infer (learn) such parameters from observations of the state of the system. In this paper, we depart from this approach by assuming that our observations are qualitative properties encoded as satisfaction of linear temporal logic formulae, as opposed to quantitative observations of the state of the system. An important feature of this approach is that it unifies naturally the system identification and the system design problems, where the properties, instead of observations, represent requirements to be satisfied. We develop a principled statistical estimation procedure based on maximising the likelihood of the system's parameters, using recent ideas from statistical machine learning. We demonstrate the efficacy and broad applicability of our method on a range of simple but non-trivial examples, including rumour spreading in social networks and hybrid models of gene regulation. © L.

The goal of this work is to introduce a simple modeling framework to study the difiusion of hoaxes and in particular how the availability of debunking information may contain their difiusion. As tra- ditionally done in the mathematical modeling of information difiusion processes, we regard hoaxes as viruses: users can become infected if they are exposed to them, and turn into spreaders as a consequence. Upon veri cation, users can also turn into non-believers and spread the same attitude with a mechanism analogous to that of the hoax-spreaders. Both believers and non-believers, as time passes, can return to a susceptible state. Our model is characterized by four pa- rameters: spreading rate, gullibility, probability to verify a hoax, and that to forget one's current belief. Simulations on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and real networks for a wide range of parameters values reveal a threshold for the fact- checking probability that guarantees the complete removal of the hoax from the network. Via a meanfield approxima- tion, we establish that the threshold value does not depend on the spreading rate but only on the gullibility and for- getting probability. Our approach allows to quantitatively gauge the minimal reaction necessary to eradicate a hoax.","Epidemi- ology; Fact-checking; Information diffusion models; Misinformation spread; Viral hoaxes",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84968546956

We present a technique to identify trending rumors, which we define as topics that include disputed factual claims. Putting aside any attempt to assess whether the rumors are true or false, it is valuable to identify trending rumors as early as possible. It is extremely difficult to accurately classify whether every individual post is or is not making a disputed factual claim. We are able to identify trending rumors by recasting the problem as finding entire clusters of posts whose topic is a disputed factual claim. The key insight is that when there is a rumor, even though most posts do not raise questions about it, there may be a few that do. If we can find signature text phrases that are used by a few people to express skepticism about factual claims and are rarely used to express anything else, we can use those as detectors for rumor clusters. Indeed, we have found a few phrases that seem to be used exactly that way, including: ""Is this true?"", ""Really?"", and ""What?"". Relatively few posts related to any particular rumor use any of these enquiry phrases, but lots of rumor diffusion processes have some posts that do and have them quite early in the diffusion. We have developed a technique based on searching for the enquiry phrases, clustering similar posts together, and then collecting related posts that do not contain these simple phrases. We then rank the clusters by their likelihood of really containing a disputed factual claim. The detector, which searches for the very rare but very informative phrases, combined with clustering and a classifier on the clusters, yields surprisingly good performance. On a typical day of Twitter, about a third of the top 50 clusters were judged to be rumors, a high enough precision that human analysts might be willing to sift through them.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963760169

The widely used web applications of online social networks, have many benefits to serve as a medium for fast, widespread information diffusion platforms. While there are substantial works on how to maximize the diffusion of useful information, there are many misinformation diffusing on social networks. How to control the misinformation diffusing efficiently with the smallest cost is still a big challenge. We tackle this challenge by reducing the problem to finding the critical blocks. The critical blocks are the sets of nodes that partition the whole network evenly at a small cost, and we believe they play a key role during the process of diffusion, and the nodes in critical blocks have advantages to span different communities in some social networks too. We prove such problem of finding critical blocks is NP-complete and therefore an exact solution is infeasible to get. A simple but effective solution is proposed by the following steps: first we convert a social network graph into a Laplacian matrix, then we compute its Fiedler Vector, which has been proved to have good properties, with the help of Fiedler Vector, we develop some heuristic algorithms to find critical blocks. We perform lots of experiments both on synthetic data, real world datasets from Twitter and coauthor networks from DBLP, the experimental results show that our algorithm is effective and efficient both on synthetic data and real world data. And we demonstrate a case analysis as an anecdotal evidence to show there do exist critical blocks in social networks and our algorithm can find them effectively and efficiently. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Critical blocks; Fiedler Vector; Information diffusion; Social networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958115908

Specifically, individuals always try to maximize their utilities through rationally selecting specific behaviors (adopting a new product, or spreading a rumor, etc.). However, utility obtained by an individual, naturally contains uncertainty, and it may stem from two sources: users' imperfect and incomplete knowledge about others, and the inherently stochastic property in human behavior. Thus, it is imperative to model and analyze the diffusion pattern under the resulting uncertainty in social networks, which, however, has not yet been deeply examined by the existing works. This paper deeply explores the pattern of gossip diffusion in social networks when uncertainty exists in users' decision making. In detail, the innovative results provided in this paper are: first, inspired by random utility theory, we formulate the diffusion model based on mixed logit model that allows for user's uncertainty in determining whether to adopt a specific strategy; second, the formal analysis framework characterizing the diffusion process is derived through the approximation method of mean field theory; finally, we explore the extensive applicability of our proposed analysis framework through modeling rumor diffusion in social networks as a coordination game. Our findings are, for various structural characteristics, small uncertainty can significantly speed up the diffusion of gossip; furthermore, social networks with scale-free property can facilitate the gossip diffusion in the easiest way, but, the range of uncertainty factor that can maximize gossip diffusion is the smallest. The obtained results perfectly comply with the philosophical saying about rumor diffusion in real social life: easy come, easy go. ï¿½ 2013 IEEE.","Behavior diffusion; random utility theory; social networks; uncertainty",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921409419

Accordingly, identifying false information, e.g. rumors circulated in social media environments, attracts expanding research attention and growing interests. Many previous studies have exploited user-independent features for rumor detection. These prior investigations uniformly treat all users relevant to the propagation of a social media message as instances of a generic entity. Such a modeling approach usually adopts a homogeneous network to represent all users, the practice of which ignores the variety across an entire user population in a social media environment. Recognizing this limitation of modeling methodologies, this study explores user-specific features in a social media environment for rumor detection. The new approach hypothesizes that whether a user tends to spread a rumor is dependent upon specific attributes of the user in addition to content characteristics of the message itself. Under this hypothesis, information propagation patterns of rumors versus those of credible messages in a social media environment are systematically differentiable. To explore and exploit this hypothesis, we develop a new information propagation model based on a heterogeneous user representation for rumor recognition. The new approach is capable of differentiating rumors from credible messages through observing distinctions in their respective propagation patterns in social media. Experimental results show that the new information propagation model based on heterogeneous user representation can effectively distinguish rumors from credible social media content. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Heterogeneous user representation and modelling; Information credibility in social media; Information propagation model; Rumor detection",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925292861

Visualizations of burst activity, propagation timeline, retweet and co-retweeted networks help its users trace the spread of a story. Within minutes TwitterTrails will collect relevant tweets and automatically answer several important questions regarding a rumor: its originator, burst characteristics, propagators and main actors according to the audience. In addition, it will compute and report the rumor's level of visibility and, as an example of the power of crowdsourcing, the audience's skepticism towards it which correlates with the rumor's credibility.

We define two structures in our MLC model: the social structure (SS) in the social layer, and the communication structure (CS) in the communicating layer. We propose two trust-building mechanisms (TBM): the social-based TBM (SBTBM) and the communicatingaimed TBM (CATBM). We discuss the trust-constructing procedure to demonstrate that an individual will sequentially decide to spread information based on three factors: the opinion environment, the individual’s social influence, and the cost to confirm the information. The model predicts that individuals will tend to create links with others in social layers to extend their social structures (social clustering principle) when they use social media. Thus, a rumor will spread because a spreading core is formed in the CS. However, a rumor will be stopped by interactions that occur in the SS. Our empirical case supports this prediction. We analyzed the topology of CS to indicate how a spreading core forms and CS evolves, and how a rumor stops spreading because social behaviors in SS encourage the development of more accurate information based on reality. © 2015 by the Association for Information Systems.","Communication structure; Rumor-spreading; Rumor-stopping; Social media; Social structure; Trust-building mechanism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925963465

Veracity is compromised by the occurrence of intentional deceptions. The nature of online news publication has changed, such that traditional fact checking and vetting from potential deception is impossible against the flood arising from content generators, as well as various formats and genres. The paper provides a typology of several varieties of veracity assessment methods emerging from two major categories – linguistic cue approaches (with machine learning), and network analysis approaches. We see promise in an innovative hybrid approach that combines linguistic cue and machine learning, with network-based behavioral data.

Our dependence on these platforms for seeking opinions, news, updates, etc. is increasing. While it is true that OSNs have become a new medium for dissemination of information, at the same time, they are also fast becoming a playground for the spread of misinformation, propaganda, fake news, rumors, unsolicited messages, etc. Consequently, we can say that an OSN platform comprises of two kinds of users namely, Spammers and Non-Spammers. Spammers, out of malicious intent, post either unwanted (or irrelevant) information or spread misinformation on OSN platforms. As part of our work, we propose mechanisms to detect such users (Spammers) in Twitter social network (a popular OSN). Our work is based on a number of features at tweet-level and user-level like Followers/Followees, URLs, Spam Words, Replies and HashTags. In our work, we have applied three learning algorithms namely Naive Bayes, Clustering and Decision trees. Furthermore, to improve detection of Spammers, a novel integrated approach is proposed which 'combines' the advantages of the three learning algorithms mentioned above. Improvement of spam detection is measured on the basis of Total Accuracy, Spammers Detection Accuracy and Non-Spammers Detection Accuracy. Results, thus obtained, show that our novel integrated approach that combines all algorithms outperforms other classical approaches in terms of overall accuracy and detect Non-Spammers with 99% accuracy with an overall accuracy of 87.9%. © 2015 IEEE.","classification algorithm; online social networking; Spam detection; Twitter",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930391468

Our model reveals a relation between rumor and truth - namely, when a rumor is diffusing, the truth about the rumor also diffuses with it. Two patterns of the agents used to identify rumor, self-identification and passive learning are taken into account. Combining theoretical proof and simulation analysis, we find that the threshold value of rumor diffusion is negatively correlated to the connectivity between nodes in the network and the probability β of agents knowing truth. Increasing β can reduce the maximum density of the rumor spreaders and slow down the generation speed of new rumor spreaders. On the other hand, we conclude that the best rumor diffusion strategy must balance the probability of forwarding rumor and the probability of agents losing interest in the rumor. High spread rate λ of rumor would lead to a surge in truth dissemination which will greatly limit the diffusion of rumor. Furthermore, in the case of unknown λ, increasing β can effectively reduce the maximum proportion of agents who do not know the truth, but cannot narrow the rumor diffusion range in a certain interval of β. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.","complex systems; diffusion dynamics; Rumor; truth",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928802499

It is imperative to model propagation dynamics of rumors and develop corresponding countermeasures. Most of the existing works either overlook the heterogeneity of social networks or do not consider the cost of countermeasures. Motivated by these issues, this paper proposes a heterogeneous network based epidemic model that incorporates both the network heterogeneity and various countermeasures. Through analyzing the existence and stability of equilibrium solutions of the proposed ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) system, the critical conditions that determine whether a rumor continuously propagates or becomes extinct are derived. Moreover, we concern about the cost of the main two types of countermeasures, i.e., Blocking rumors at influential users and spreading truth to clarify rumors. Employing the Pontryagin's maximum principle, we obtain the optimized countermeasures that ensures a rumor can become extinct at the end of an expected time period with lowest cost. Both the critical conditions and the optimized countermeasures provide a real-time decision reference to restrain the rumor spreading. Experiments based on Digg2009 dataset are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic model and the efficiency of the optimized countermeasures. © 2015 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944315215

In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of people spreading misleading information or rumours (i.e. counter-knowledge) about friends and other people thanks to social media platforms. The purpose of this paper is to identify the role played by social networks in the process of creating counter-knowledge, focusing on the counter-knowledge that users develop in the context of SNS and its effect on utilitarian benefits. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyses these effects through an empirical investigation of 236 users of SNSs. The methodology involves the construction and analysis of a structural equation model from a review of relevant literature. Findings: The results confirm that, although the context of SNSs is a variable that will lead to positive effects on counter-knowledge, the relationship between counter-knowledge and utilitarian benefits becomes statistically insignificant. The results also showed that the content on social networks may lead to higher levels of utilitarian benefits. This either amplifies or helps to encourage cooperation among users and providers of rumours, beliefs and assumptions about what they think is the truth. Originality/value: From a user perspective, few, if any, studies of SNS have considered the relationship between the information collected and generated by SNS and counter-knowledge. Therefore, the results of this study lead the authors to advise managers of SNSs considering that most but not all the content on SNSs is associated with the spread of rumours, misinformation and unverified claims. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Counter-knowledge; Social media; Social networking sites; Utilitarian benefits",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937391412

Therefore, emergency management strategies are developed to mitigate the impact of these unfortunate events. The introduction of social media into the domain of emergency management may bring several benefits. For instance, governments disseminate information regarding an incident to the community, citizens communicate their current status to family and friends, and also community members coordinate with each other. While there are obvious advantages to utilizing social media during emergency situations, there are risks as well. The efficacy of an emergency response approach that leverages social media is contingent upon the quality and credibility of the information transmitted via social media. Potential issues include misinterpretation by the public, false alarms, and the spread of counterproductive rumors.

Around elections time, Twitter data have been used to measure public opinion on issues such as predicting outcomes, voting intention or political alignment. However, the effect of proliferation of new forms of spam on social media in this type of measurements has not been completely recognized and tackled in research. In this paper, we focus on detecting malicious accounts on Twitter, which aim to spread spam in an electoral process (e. g., disseminate rumors, misinform, or artificially inflate support for a candidate). To achieve this, a dataset of 149K users referring to Colombia 2014 presidential election was collected, and 1.7 million tweets and 341K URLs were crawled from their timeline. To distinguish malicious accounts from non-spammer ones in the dataset, several machine learning techniques were implemented on a labeled collection of users, semi-automatically classified into spammer and non-spammer. Experimental results reveal that with ten tweets, the proposed strategy detects 93% of spammers and 92% of non-spammers. Results also highlight the importance of noise removal when measurements of public opinion are conducted using Twitter data, with approximately 22% of accounts in the dataset classified as spammers. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Colombia; Politics; Presidential election; Social spammers; Spammer detection; Twitter",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952673721

Most of the collaborative sites allow users to easily create an account and start accessing the content. Social media services such as collaborative project's single user constantly creates many accounts with different account names not long after a block has been applied. The blocked person who creates multiple accounts is called sockpuppet. Current mechanism for detecting deception are based on human deception detection (e.g., speech or text). Although these method have high detection accuracy, but it cannot be applied in databases with large volumes of data. So they are computationally inefficient. There is an efficient method for detecting identity deception by using both Nonverbal (e.g., user activity or Movement) and Verbal Behavior (facial expression, text) in the social media environment. These methods increase high detection accuracy.

However, in real-world social networks, users have their own interests (which can be represented as topics) and are more likely to be influenced by their friends (or friends' friends) with similar topics. We can increase the influence spread by taking into consideration topics. To address this problem, we study topic-aware influence maximization, which, given a topic-aware influence maximization (TIM) query, finds k seeds from a social network such that the topic-aware influence spread of the k seeds is maximized. Our goal is to enable online TIM queries. Since the topic-aware influence maximization problem is NP-hard, we focus on devising effcient algorithms to achieve instant performance while keeping a high influence spread. We utilize a maximum influence arborescence (MIA) model to approximate the computation of influence spread. To effciently find k seeds under the MIA model, we first propose a best-effort algorithm with 1-1/e approximation ratio, which estimates an upper bound of the topic-aware influence of each user and utilizes the bound to prune large numbers of users with small influence. We devise effective techniques to estimate tighter upper bounds. We then propose a faster topic-sample-based algorithm with ε. (1-1/e ) approximation ratio for any ε ε (0; 1], which materializes the influence spread of some topic-distribution samples and utilizes the materialized information to avoid computing the actual influence of users with small in uences.

Fundamentally, the problem can be cast as studying evolving subgraphs (each subgraph corresponding to a topical community) on an underlying social graph - with users as nodes and the connection between them as edges. A key metric of interest in this setting is tracking the changes to the conductance of subgraphs induced by edge activations. This metric quantifies how well or poorly connected a subgraph is to the rest of the graph relative to its internal connections. Conductance has been demonstrated to be of great use in many applications, such as identifying bursty topics, tracking the spread of rumors, and so on. However, tracking this simple metric presents a considerable scalability challenge - the underlying social network is large, the number of communities that are active at any moment is large, the rate at which these communities evolve is high, and moreover, we need to track conductance in real-time.

However, untrusted users can take advantage of these sites as gateways to make money, spread rumors and so on. This paper proposes a label propagation algorithm based on the trust model to detect the untrusted users on social networking sites. The algorithm consists of two main steps. Firstly, we conduct a hybrid graph with three types of nodes (users, tweets, topics) to model the trust relationship between each user pair. Secondly, we utilize a new method inspired by the Label Propagation Algorithm to detect more untrusted users based on a small known seed set. We conduct experiments with a real data set, and the evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed solution. © 2014 IEEE.","Hybrid graph; Label propagation; Trust model; Untrusted user detection",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923011751

However, many user profiles in OSNs contain deceptive information. Existing studies have shown that lying in OSNs is quite widespread, often for protecting a user’s privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting deceptive profiles in OSNs. We specifically define a set of analysis methods for detecting deceptive information about user genders and locations in Twitter. First, we collected a large dataset of Twitter profiles and tweets. Next, we defined methods for gender guessing from Twitter profile colors and names. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian classification and K-means clustering algorithms to Twitter profile characteristics (e.g., profile layout colors, first names, user names, and spatiotemporal information) and geolocations to analyze the user behavior. We establish the overall accuracy of each indicator through extensive experimentation with our crawled dataset. Based on the outcomes of our approach, we are able to detect deceptive profiles about gender and location with a reasonable accuracy. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Deception detection; Gender classification; Location classification; Profile characteristics; Profile classification; Profile indicators; Twitter",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947287167

Given the open and dynamic nature of social media infrastructure, the governance structures of social commerce are usually realized through reputation mechanisms. However, the existing approaches to the prediction of trust in future interactions are based on personal observations and/or publicly shared information in social commerce application. As a result, the indications are unreliable and biased because of limited first-hand information and stakeholder manipulation for personal strategic interests. Methods that extract trust values from social links among users can improve the performance of reputation mechanisms. Nonetheless, these links may not always be available and are typically sparse in social commerce, especially for new users. Thus, this study proposes a new graph-based comprehensive reputation model to build trust by fully exploiting the social context of opinions based on the activities and relationship networks of opinion contributors. The proposed model incorporates the behavioral activities and social relationship reputations of users to combat the scarcity of first-hand information and identifies a set of critical trust factors to mitigate the subjectivity of opinions and the dynamics of behaviors. Furthermore, we enhance the model by developing a novel deception filtering approach to discard ""bad-mouthing"" opinions and by exploiting a personalized direct distrust (risk) metric to identify malicious providers. Experimental results show that the proposed reputation model can outperform other trust and reputation models in most cases. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Everyday, millions of messages are created, commented, and shared by people on social media websites, such as Twitter and Facebook. This provides valuable data for researchers and practitioners in many application domains, such as marketing, to inform decision-making. Distilling valuable social signals from the huge crowd's messages, however, is challenging, due to the heterogeneous and dynamic crowd behaviors. The challenge is rooted in data analysts' capability of discerning the anomalous information behaviors, such as the spreading of rumors or misinformation, from the rest that are more conventional patterns, such as popular topics and newsworthy events, in a timely fashion. FluxFlow incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, and offers a set of novel visualization designs for presenting the detected threads for deeper analysis. We evaluated FluxFlow with real datasets containing the Twitter feeds captured during significant events such as Hurricane Sandy. Through quantitative measurements of the algorithmic performance and qualitative interviews with domain experts, the results show that the back-end anomaly detection model is effective in identifying anomalous retweeting threads, and its front-end interactive visualizations are intuitive and useful for analysts to discover insights in data and comprehend the underlying analytical model. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","anomaly detection; information visualization; machine learning; Retweeting threads; social media; visual analytics",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910048383

Currently, there are mainly two types of methods 1) blocking rumors at the most influential users or community bridges, or 2) spreading truths to clarify the rumors. Each method claims the better performance among all the others according to their own considerations and environments. However, there must be one standing out of the rest. In this paper, we focus on this part of work. The difficulty is that there does not exist a universal standard to evaluate them. In order to address this problem, we carry out a series of empirical and theoretical analysis on the basis of the introduced mathematical model. Based on this mathematical platform, each method will be evaluated by using real OSN data.We have done three types of analysis in this work. First, we compare all the measures of locating important users. The results suggest that the degree and betweenness measures outperform all the others in the Facebook network. Second, we analyze the method of the truth clarification method, and find that this method has a long-term performance while the degree measure performs well only in the early stage. Third, in order to leverage these two methods, we further explore the strategy of different methods working together and their equivalence. Given a fixed budget in the real world, our analysis provides a potential solution to find out a better strategy by integrating both types of methods together. From both the academic and technical perspective, the work in this paper is an important step towards the most practical and optimal strategies of restraining rumors in OSNs. © 2013 IEEE.","Defense; Online social network; Propagation; Rumors",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910602883

Especially, people increasingly use internet media and SNS (twitter, facebook, blog, and etc.), to share opinions, news, advice, interests, moods, concerns, critics, facts, rumors, and everything. Therefore, public health research has been started a big change. Traditional public health study has depended on only regular clinical reports by health professionals. It is limited to practical use and general public has much difficulty to understand health information, even if it's his/her own information. Nowadays, over one billion people publish their ideas about many topics, including health conditions minute by minute. SNS provides researchers the freshest source of public health conditions on a global scale. Much of that data is public and available for mining. So this article pursues making an application of opinion mining for detecting the public's trend and finding valuable opinion among the massive information. The core of this research is analyzing the adjective of opinions. Our assumption is that many adjective expressions implicate deep and sincere meaning of its author. It is applicable for both low value postings filtering and tracking high value postings simultaneously. This approach is a simple and feasible criteria. The opinion mining process includes Korean morpheme analysis, opinion extraction, opinion tagging, positive/negative score evaluation.

In order for OSNs to continue expanding their role as a communication medium in our society, it is crucial for information posted on OSNs to be trusted. Here we define a set of analysis methods for detecting deceptive information about user genders in Twitter. In addition, we report empirical results with our stratified data set consisting of 174,600 Twitter profiles with a 50-50 breakdown between male and female users. Our automated approach compares gender indicators obtained from different profile characteristics including first name, user name, and layout colors. We establish the overall accuracy of each indicator and the strength of all possible values for each indicator through extensive experimentations with our data set. We define male trending users and female trending users based on two factors, namely the overall accuracy of each characteristic and the relative strength of the value of each characteristic for a given user. We apply a Bayesian classifier to the weighted average of characteristics for each user. We flag for possible deception profiles that we classify as male or female in contrast with a self-declared gender that we obtain independently of Twitter profiles. Finally, we use manual inspections on a subset of profiles that we identify as potentially deceptive in order to verify the correctness of our predictions. © 2014 IEEE.","Deception detection; gender classification; profile characteristics; Twitter",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911166843

Design/methodology/approach - Wepresent a case study of how rumors spread on Twitter during a recent disaster situation, the Great East Japan earthquake of March 11, 2011, based on comparison to a normal situation. We specifically examine rumor disaffirmation because automatic rumor extraction is difficult. Extracting rumor-disaffirmation is easier than extracting the rumors themselves. We classify tweets in disaster situations, analyze tweets in disaster situations based on users' impressions and compare the spread of rumor tweets in a disaster situation to that in a normal situation. Findings - The analysis results showed the following characteristics of rumors in a disaster situation. The information transmission is 74.9 per cent, representing the greatest number of tweets in our data set. Rumor tweets give users strong behavioral facilitation, make them feel negative and foment disorder. Rumors of a normal situation spread through many hierarchies but the rumors of disaster situations are two or three hierarchies, which means that the rumor spreading style differs in disaster situations and in normal situations. Originality/value - The originality of this paper is to target rumors on Twitter and to analyze rumor characteristics by multiple aspects using not only rumor-tweets but also disaffirmation-tweets as an investigation object. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advanced web applications; Web mining; Web search and information extraction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926678915

Unlike previous studies on detecting rumors using tweets' inherent attributes generally, in this work, we shift the premise and focus on identifying event rumors on Weibo by extracting features from crowd responses that are texts of retweets (reposting tweets) and comments under a certain social event. Firstly the paper proposes a method of collecting theme data, including a sample set of tweets which have been confirmed to be false rumors based on information from the official rumor-busting service provided by Weibo. Secondly clustering analysis of tweets are made to examine the text features extracted from retweets and comments, and a classifier is trained based on observed feature distribution to automatically judge rumors from a mixed set of valid news and false information. The experiments show that the new features we propose are indeed effective in the classification, and especially some stop words and punctuations which are treated as noises in previous works can play an important role in rumor detection.

In this paper, we introduce three roles, which are rumor maker, accomplice and innocent, into social networks. Rumor makers are people who distribute rumors in social networks. In order to propagate rumor as more people as possible, rumor maker cannot achieve this goal without others' help. So that accomplices are people who help rumor maker spread rumors. Innocent are people who do not share help for rumors spreading. We introduce an extended cellular automata algorithm, i.e. Hadoop Cellular Automata (HCA), to simulate people's tweeting activity in social networks. We deploy our experiments on an open source platform, Hadoop. Our result shows that Hadoop Cellular Automata is a liner algorithm. Also HCA can simulate people's tweeting activity very well and can pick out rumors easily in social networks. © 2013 IEEE.","cellular automata; rumor spreading; social networks",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919655248

The cognitive process involved in the decision to spread information involves answering four main questions viz consistency of message, coherency of message, credibility of source and general acceptability of message. We have used the cues of deception to analyse these questions to obtain solutions for preventing the spread of misinformation. We have proposed an algorithm to effectively detect deliberate spread of false information which would enable users to make informed decisions while spreading information in social networks.

Although these methods yield a high detection accuracy rate, they are computationally inefficient for the social media environment, which often involves databases with large volumes of data.

Thus, it is necessary to find effective strategies to control the spread of rumor. Specifically, in our paper, we consider such a setting: initially, a subset of nodes is chosen as the set of protectors, and the influence of protector diffuses competitively with the diffusion of rumor. However, in real world, we generally have limited budget (limited number of protectors) and time to fight with rumor. Therefore, we study the problem of maximizing rumor containment within a fixed number of initial protectors and a given time deadline. Generalizing two seminal models in the field—the Independent Cascade (IC) model and the Linear Threshold (LT) model—we propose two new models of competitive influence diffusion in social networks with the following three factors: a time deadline for information diffusion, random time delay of information exchange and personal interests regarding the acceptance of information. Under these two models, we show that the optimization problems are NP-hard. Furthermore, we prove that the objective functions are submodular. As a result, the greedy algorithm is used as constant-factor approximation algorithms with performance guarantee $$1-\frac{1}{e}$$1-1e for the two optimization problems. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Influence diffusion; Personal interests; Rumor containment; Time deadline; Time delay",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925789611

Not much is known about this phenomenon until very recently when social networks provide a more efficient way for online rumor spreading. Microblogging platform, like Twitter and Sina Weibo, provides an ideal environment not only for rumor spreading, but also fruitful data to reveal the underlying rules controlling the birth, spread, and death of rumors. In this paper, we try to answer the following questions which have been confusing people for years. How do rumor propagate in the network? How do human factors affect the spreading patterns of rumor? How do we construct models to understand the collective group behavior based on probabilistic individual choices? Our study on microblogging systems help to expose the digital traces of online rumor spreading, which offers an opportunity to investigate how netizens interact with each other in the process of rumor spreading. Based on the analysis of the interactions, we propose a mathematical model running on real topologies to simulate this process and explore the characteristics of online rumor spreading. Experiments show that our model can reflect the transmission pattern of real rumors. Our work is different from previous ones by pointing out that a subset of the population can work as “Resisters” who are proactively persuading their neighbors not to believe the rumor, while previous works only label them as the “silent” nodes.

Low quality information such as spam and rumors is a nuisance to people and hinders them from consuming information that is pertinent to them or that they are looking for. Although individual social networks are capable of filtering a significant amount of low quality information they receive, they usually require large amounts of resources (e.g, personnel) and incur a delay before detecting new types of low quality information. Also the evolution of various low quality information posts lots of challenges to defensive techniques.

For evolutionary study of low quality information, we present the results on large-scale study on Web spam and email spam over a long period of time. Furthermore, we provide activity-based detection approaches to filter out low quality information in social networks: click traffic analysis of short URL spam, behavior analysis of URL spam and information diffusion analysis of rumor. Our framework and detection techniques show promising results in analyzing and detecting low quality information in social networks. © 2014 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901753291

In this paper, we develop a general algorithm called TIA (short for Troll Identification Algorithm) to classify users of an online 'signed' social network as malicious (e.g. trolls on Slashdot) or benign (i.e. normal honest users). Though applicable to many signed social networks, TIA has been tested on troll detection on Slashdot Zoo under a wide variety of parameter settings.

However, we recently observe that various malicious information, such as computer virus and rumors, are broadly spread via social networks. To restrict these malicious information, it is critical to develop effective method to discover the diffusion source nodes in social networks. Many pioneer works have explored the source node identification problem, but they all based on an ideal assumption that there is only a single source node, neglecting the fact that malicious information are often diffused from multiple sources to intentionally avoid network audit. In this paper, we present a multi-source locating method based on a given snapshot of partially and sparsely observed infected nodes in the network. Specifically, we first present a reverse propagation method to detect recovered and unobserved infected nodes in the network, and then we use community cluster algorithms to change the multi-source locating problem into a bunch of single source locating problems. At the last step, we identify the nodes having the largest likelihood estimations as the source node on the infected clusters. Experiments on three different types of complex networks show the performance of the proposed method. © The Authors.

The prevalence of SM use globally and its growing significance to the evolution of events has attracted the attention of the Army and other agencies charged with protecting national security interests. The information exchanged in SM sites and the networks of people who interact with these online communities can provide value to Army intelligence efforts. SM could facilitate the Military Decision Making Process by providing ongoing assessment of military actions from a local citizen perspective. Despite potential value, there are significant technological barriers to leveraging SM. SM collection and analysis are difficult in the dynamic SM environment and deception is a real concern. This paper introduces a credibility analysis approach and prototype fact-finding technology called the ""Apollo Fact-finder"" that mitigates the problem of inaccurate or falsified SM data. Apollo groups data into sets (or claims), corroborating specific observations, then iteratively assesses both claim and source credibility resulting in a ranking of claims by likelihood of occurrence. These credibility analysis approaches are discussed in the context of a conflict event, the Syrian civil war, and applied to tweets collected in the aftermath of the Syrian chemical weapons crisis.","Credibility analysis; Social media; Text analytics",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906342324

Much of the work in this context has been carried out under the 1-threshold model, where diffusion occurs when a node has just one neighbor with the contagion. We study the problem of inhibiting more complex contagions in social networks where nodes may have thresholds larger than 1. The goal is to minimize the propagation of the contagion by removing a small number of nodes (called critical nodes) from the network. We study several versions of this problem and prove that, in general, they cannot even be efficiently approximated to within any factor ρ≥1, unless P = NP. We develop efficient and practical heuristics for these problems and carry out an experimental study of their performance on three well known social networks, namely epinions, wikipedia and slashdot. Our results show that these heuristics perform significantly better than five other known methods.

The problem is that in order to prevent from being detected, spammers are likely to pretend to be normal, and what's more, some normal users also engage into spam spreading for financial benefits, making detection more difficult. In this paper, we solve the detection problem from the view of user influence.

But when a spam campaign is launched, usually in order to influent others, a great many of spammers engaged into propagation, the original poster's influence would get a sudden increase, making him outstanding from the others.

In this paper, we study the group emotion evolution process with the agent based simulation method. Along the way, the events-chain model is proposed to modeling the over-lapping influence of the temporal successive events. The simulation experiments of correlation events and events-chain model of a real public incident are performed based on the constructed framework. The results show that the group emotion evolution processes of correlation events have different patterns with the single event, and they cannot analyze as two independent events.

While deception has been studied from the perspective of interpersonal interaction, little is known about social structural characteristics of deceptive communication. To fill the knowledge gap, this research investigates deception behavior in computer mediated communication (CMC) via the lens of social structure by answering the questions of how one deceiver socially interacts with multiple receivers and what structural characteristics can be used to delineate deception in CMC. To this end, we first conceptualize deception in terms of social structure by drawing on the interpersonal deception and social network theories. We then propose a model of structural behaviors of deception in CMC that consists of three components: centrality, cohesion, and similarity, followed by an empirical evaluation of the model with real-world data collected from a game website. The findings of this study provide new evidence that deception is a strategic activity where the deceiver juggles between the dual goals of promoting his or her deceptive agenda and avoiding detection. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Computer-mediated communication; Deception; Deception behavior; Social network analysis; Social structural approach",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901997566

Several nations are developing defensive and offensive cyber capabilities for this domain. The nature of warfare in cyberspace is radically different than the traditional warfare: the attacks are more remote, stealthy and it may be impossible to detect the identity of the adversary (Greengard, 2010). Moreover, the time parameter becomes extremely important in this domain since conducting an attack takes only seconds even if the target is at the globally farthest point possible. Therefore, the power and impacts of cyber operations are limited by fast computation and transmission skills of your front. Nations need intelligence in this relatively new domain of war in order to know the strengths and weaknesses of other nations and themselves. With cyber intelligence of high quality, nations can assess the effects of attacks; detect their vulnerabilities, therefore mitigating the risks and implement cyber security processes based on well-defined decisions (Rudner, 2013). This paper presents a literature survey on computer science methodologies that can be useful for intelligence officers working in the cyberspace.

There are both positive and negative effects of social media coverage of events, it can be used by authorities for effective disaster management or by malicious entities to spread rumors and fake news. The aim of this paper, is to highlight the role of Twitter, during Hurricane Sandy (2012) to spread fake images about the disaster. We identified 10,350 unique tweets containing fake images that were circulated on Twitter, during Hurricane Sandy. We performed a characterization analysis, to understand the temporal, social reputation and influence patterns for the spread of fake images. Eighty six percent of tweets spreading the fake images were retweets, hence very few were original tweets. Our results showed that top thirty users out of 10,215 users (0.3%) resulted in 90% of the retweets of fake images; also network links such as follower relationships of Twitter, contributed very less (only 11%) to the spread of these fake photos URLs. Next, we used classification models, to distinguish fake images from real images of Hurricane Sandy. Best results were obtained from Decision Tree classifier, we got 97% accuracy in predicting fake images from real. Also, tweet based features were very effective in distinguishing fake images tweets from real, while the performance of user based features was very poor. Our results, showed that, automated techniques can be used in identifying real images from fake images posted on Twitter.","Crisis; Fake pictures; Online social media; Twitter",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893135215

Rumors block adequate information sharing and cause severe problems. Several studies have analyzed rumors, but it remains unclear how rumors are spread on microblogging systems. As described in this paper, we present a case study of how rumors are spread on Twitter in a recent disaster situation, that of the Great East Japan earthquake in March 11 2011, based on comparison to a normal situation. We also specifically examine the correction of rumors because automatic extraction of rumors is difficult, but extracting rumor-correction is easier than extracting the rumors themselves. We (1) classify tweets in disaster situations, (2) analyze tweets in disaster situations based on user's impression, and (3) compare the spread of rumor tweets in a disaster situation to that in a normal situation.

This is done by intentional dissemination of a made-to-order rumor while simultaneously covertly launching cyberattacks as a catalyst to this process.

We show that the objective function of the γ - k rumor restriction problem is submodular, and use this result to design a greedy approximation algorithm with performance ratio of 1 - 1/ε for the problem under the linear threshold model and independent cascade model, respectively.

To make the social network as a reliable medium, it is necessary to have strategies to control rumor diffusion. In this article, we address the Least Cost Rumor Blocking (LCRB) problem where rumors originate from a community Cr in the network and a notion of protectors are used to limit the bad influence of rumors. The problem can be summarized as identifying a minimal subset of individuals as initial protectors to minimize the number of people infected in neighbor communities of Cr at the end of both diffusion processes. Observing the community structure property, we pay attention to a kind of vertex set, called bridge end set, in which each node has at least one direct in-neighbor in Cr and is reachable from rumors. Under the OOAO model, we study LCRB-P problem, in which &amp;alpha; (0 &lt; 1) fraction of bridge ends are required to be protected. We prove that the objective function of this problem is submodular and a greedy algorithm is adopted to derive a (1 - 1/e)-approximation. Furthermore, we study LCRB-D problem over the DOAA model, in which all the bridge ends are required to be protected, we prove that there is no polynomial time o(ln n)-approximation for the LCRB-D problem unless P = NP, and propose a Set Cover Based Greedy (SCBG) algorithm which achieves a O(ln n)-approximation ratio. Finally, to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm, we conduct extensive comparison simulations in three real-world datasets, and the results show that our algorithm outperforms other heuristics. © 2013 IEEE.","approximation algorithm; deterministic One-Activate-Many model; least cost rumor blocking; opportunistic One-Activate-One model; social networks",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893278750

In this paper, we try to mine these new social networks using Wave Propagation process and mainly discuss two applications of our model, solving Message Broadcasting problem and Rumor Spreading problem. Our model has the following advantages: (1) We can simulate the real networks message transmitting process in time since we include a time factor in our model.

The information credibility is assessed calculating the ratio of the same opinions to all opinions about a topic. To identify the topic of a tweet, topic models are generated using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. To identify if an opinion of the tweet is positive or negative, sentiment analysis is performed using a semantic orientation dictionary. However, the accuracy of the method is susceptible to the number of tweets. That is to say, if the number of tweets with the same topic is small, the denominator is reduced. Thus the accuracy is also reduced. To cope with this problem, a new method of providing an expertise score is proposed. The score is used to calculate the information credibility depending on user's knowledge (expertise).

Among various psychophysiological behaviors, eye movement has been identified as one of the most reliable sources of deception behavior in face-to-face communication. However, empirical studies of eye movement behavior in online deception remain scarce. In this research, we investigated eye gazing behaviors of deceivers in online video chatting. Based on the findings of previous deception studies and the unique characteristics of online video chatting, we hypothesized that online deception has an impact on eye gazing behaviors. In addition, we innovatively operationalized eye gazing behaviors in terms of areas of interest. We conducted a lab-based experiment to test the hypotheses. The results supported the effect of deception on eye gazing behaviors. The findings of this study provide insights on how to improve the performance of online deception detection and how to apply eye tracking technologies to understand emerging human behaviors in online communication. © (2013) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","Eye movement; Gaze behavior; Online deception; Psychophysiological behavior",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893295716

In typical source localization methods, the sources are assumed to be acoustic or RF; sensors are placed in different zones to listen to these sources where each zone-to-sensor has a unique path loss and delay. Since each zone has a path loss and delay to each sensor, the sensing matrix is full and the problem of source localization effectively reduces to a sparse signal recovery problem. On the contrary, we are interested in scenarios where the sources may not have an acoustic or RF signature, e.g., locating a vehicle with cameras or a rumor in a social network; and a very few sensors may be able to sense the sources due to obstacles/occlusions. In other words, instead of having a full sensing matrix (as in sparse recovery), the sensing matrix is now highly sparse. To this aim, we provide a protocol for the sensors to collaborate among each other and devise a frequency-domain approach to assist an interrogator to locate the source. In particular, an interrogator (e.g., a UAV) analyzes the Frequency-Response (FR) of the collaborated statistic at an arbitrary sensor, and moves to a neighboring sensor whose FR magnitude is the largest among all the neighbors. With carefully designed collaboration, we show that the FR magnitude at any sensor increases in the direction of the source. In order to locate multiple sources, we characterize the diversity in the sources to arrive at their successful identification. © 2013 IEEE.","Decentralized system; Frequency-Response; Source localization",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897716595

In this paper, we focus on epidemic processes over one such class of networks, Opportunistic Networks, where mobile nodes within range can communicate with each other directly. As the node degree distribution is a salient property for process dynamics on complex networks, we use the well known Configuration Model, that captures generic degree distributions, for modeling and analysis. We also assume that information spreading between two neighboring nodes can only occur during random contact times. Using this model, we proceed to derive closed-form approximative formulas for the information spreading delay that only require the first and second moments of the node degree distribution. Despite the simplicity of our model, simulations based on both synthetic and real traces suggest a considerable accuracy for a large range of heterogeneous contact networks arising in this context, validating its usefulness for performance prediction. © 2013 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883118584

She is a member of the National Society of Collegiate Scholars, Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity, and the Golden Key International Honour Society. The DAWN (Dynamic Adjustable Weighted Network) Algorithm randomly generates realistic, dynamic, and weighted artificial social networks. Resulting networks demonstrate scale-free degree distributions as well as realistic clustering coefficients and average path lengths. Additionally, networks are dynamic, allowing nodes to leave and enter the networks, and edges to be created, removed, or re-weighted in each iteration. Edges are asymmetrically weighted in terms of frenergy, a metric that measures the effort put in to maintaining a friendship. Networks under the DAWN algorithm approach a steady state where overall metrics, including size, clustering coefficient, path length, and degree distribution, remain generally stable. However, nodes and edges follow agent-based rules, and therefore networks continue to change locally. The DAWN algorithm provides realistic artificial social networks over which rumor propagation, reliability testing, sensitivity analysis, and other areas of research may be performed. Results were found using Monte Carlo simulation techniques.","Agent-based models; Discrete time modeling; Social network modeling",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880658212

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role microblogs play in providing social support following the death of a public figure, Michael Jackson, ""the King of Pop"". Design/methodology/approach - In total, 50,000 tweets from the first 12 days after Jackson's death were harvested from Twitter. A content analysis using a coding instrument characterizing a set of social support categories was conducted. Categories not related to social support were also inductively constructed and applied to the tweets. Findings - Twitter was primarily used for providing informational support, followed by emotional support. Surprisingly, categories not normally associated with grieving, such as spreading of rumours, expressions of hatred, and spam, also occupied a large proportion of tweets. Practical implications - Results suggest that microblogging has the potential to facilitate the grieving process and in some aspects of social support. However, information quality could be an issue that calls for better information management tools. Originality/value - There has been little work done in examining microblogs as platforms for grieving in general, and more specifically, for providing social support during bereavement. The present research is timely, as we seek to understand the role microblogs play in the grieving process. Copyright © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In the diffusion of these ""simple contagions"", which can spread through a single contact, a small network diameter and the existence of weak ties in the network play important roles. Recent studies by sociolo- gists [Centola and Macy 2007] have also explored ""complex contagions"" in which multiple contacts are required for the spread of contagion. [Centola and Macy 2007] and [Romero et al. 2011] have shown that complex contagions exhibit different diffusion patterns than simple ones. In this paper, we study three small world models and provide rigorous analysis on the diffusion speed of a k-complex contagion, in which a node becomes active only when at least k of its neighbors are active. Diffusion of a complex contagion starts from a constant number of initial active nodes. We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of rounds it takes for the entire network to be activated. Our results show that compared to simple contagions, weak ties are not as effective in spreading complex contagions due to the lack of simultaneous active contacts; and the diffusion speed depends heavily on the the way weak ties are distributed in a network. We show that in Newman-Watts model with Θ(n) random edges added on top of a ring structure, the diffusion speed of a 2-complex contagion is ( 3√n) and O( 5pn4 log n) with high probability. In Kleinberg's small world model (in which Θ(n) random edges are added with a spatial distribution inversely proportional to the grid distance to the power of 2, on top of a 2-dimensional grid structure), the diffusion speed of a 2- complex contagion is O(log3.5 n) and (log n/ log log n) with high probability. We also show a similar result for Kleinberg's hierarchical network model, in which random edges are added with a spatial distribution on their distance in a tree hierarchy. In this model the diffusion is fast with high probability bounded by O(log n) and (log n/ log log n), when the number of random edges issued by each node is Θ(log2 n). We also generalize these results to k-complex contagions.

Alongside these promising features, however, comes the threat of misinformation propagation which can lead to undesirable effects. Due to the sheer number of online social network (OSN) users and the highly clustered structures commonly shared by these kinds of networks, there is a substantial challenge to efficiently contain viral spread of misinformation in large-scale social networks. In this paper, we focus on how to limit viral propagation of misinformation in OSNs. Particularly, we study a set of problems, namely the βTI-Node Protectors problems, which aim to find the smallest set of highly influential nodes from which disseminating good information helps to contain the viral spread of misinformation, initiated from a set of nodes I, within a desired fraction (1-β) of the nodes in the entire network in T time steps. For this family of problems, we analyze and present solutions including their inapproximability results, greedy algorithms that provide better lower bounds on the number of selected nodes, and a community-based method for solving these problems. We further conduct a number of experiments on real-world traces, and the empirical results show that our proposed methods outperform existing alternative approaches in finding those important nodes that can help to contain the spread of misinformation effectively. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike previous studies on detecting spams such as ads, pornographic messages and phishing, we focus on identifying event rumors (rumors about social events), which are more harmful than other kinds of spams especially in China. To detect event rumors from enormous posts, we studied the characteristics of event rumors and extracted features which can distinguish rumors from ordinary posts. The experiments conducted on real dataset show that the new features are effective to improve the rumor classifier. Further analysis of the event rumors reveals that they can be classified into 4 different types. We propose an approach for detecting one major type, text-picture unmatched event rumors.

Through qualitative and statistical analyses, our results identify seven reaction patterns to rumors and their different development trends. We reveal a three-stage pattern of the change of leadership during the rumor discussions. By connecting social theories on rumor transmission to the large scale social platform, this paper offers insight into understanding rumor development in social media, as well as utilizing microblogging data for effectively detecting, analyzing and controlling public rumors.

During disasters such as Hurricane Sandy and the tsunami in Japan people used social media to report injuries as well as send out their requests. During social movements such as Occupy Wall Street (OWS) and the Arab Spring, people extensively used social media to organize their events and spread the news. As more people rely on social media for political, social, and business events, it is more susceptible to become a place for evildoers to use it to spread misinformation and rumors. Therefore, users have the challenge to discern which piece of information is credible or not. They also need to find ways to assess the credibility of information. This problem becomes more important when the source of the information is not known to the consumer. In this paper we propose a method to measure user credibility in social media. We study the situations in which we cannot assess the credibility of the content or the credibility of the user (source of the information) based on the user's profile. We propose the CredRank algorithm to measure user credibility in social media. The algorithm analyzes social media users' online behavior to measure their credibility. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Behavior Analysis; Information Credibility; Misinformation",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874813795

Social networking sites provide a platform for the rapid interchange of information and hence, for the rapid dissemination of unsubstantiated claims that are potentially harmful. In this paper, we study different methods for combating rumors in social networks actuated by the realization that authoritarian methods for fighting rumor have largely failed. Our major insight is that in situations where populations do not answer to the same authority, it is the trust that individuals place in their friends that must be leveraged to fight rumor. In other words, rumor is best combated by something which acts like itself, a message which spreads from one individual to another. We call such messages anti-rumors. We study three natural anti-rumor processes to counter the rumor and present mean field equations that characterize the system. Several metrics are proposed to capture the properties of rumor and anti-rumor processes. The metrics are geared to capture temporal evolution as well as global properties of the processes. We evaluate our methods by simulating rumor and anti-rumor processes on a large data set of around 10 nodes derived from the social networking site Twitter and on a synthetic network of the same size generated according to the Barab\'asi-Albert model.","anti-rumor; diffusion; Rumor; social networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874349125

Many times networks over which contagions spread are unobserved, and such networks are often dynamic and change over time. In this paper, we investigate the problem of inferring dynamic networks based on information diffusion data. We assume there is an unobserved dynamic network that changes over time, while we observe the results of a dynamic process spreading over the edges of the network. The task then is to infer the edges and the dynamics of the underlying network. We develop an on-line algorithm that relies on stochastic convex optimization to efficiently solve the dynamic network inference problem. We apply our algorithm to information diffusion among 3.3 million mainstream media and blog sites and experiment with more than 179 million different pieces of information spreading over the network in a one year period. We study the evolution of information pathways in the online media space and find interesting insights. Information pathways for general recurrent topics are more stable across time than for on-going news events. Clusters of news media sites and blogs often emerge and vanish in matter of days for on-going news events. Major social movements and events involving civil population, such as the Libyan'{}s civil war or Syria'{}s uprise, lead to an increased amount of information pathways among blogs as well as in the overall increase in the network centrality of blogs and social media sites. © 2013 ACM.","blogs; information cascades; meme-tracking; networks of diffusion; news media; social networks",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874233367

Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, OSNs can be used to harvest private user data, distribute malware, control botnets, perform surveillance, spread misinformation, and even influence algorithmic trading. Usually, an adversary starts off by running an infiltration campaign using hijacked or adversary-owned OSN accounts, with an objective to connect with a large number of users in the targeted OSN. In this article, we evaluate how vulnerable OSNs are to a large-scale infiltration campaign run by socialbots: bots that control OSN accounts and mimic the actions of real users. We adopted the design of a traditional web-based botnet and built a prototype of a Socialbot Network (SbN): a group of coordinated programmable socialbots. We operated our prototype on Facebook for 8 weeks, and collected data about user behavior in response to a large-scale infiltration campaign. Our results show that (1) by exploiting known social behaviors of users, OSNs such as Facebook can be infiltrated with a success rate of up to 80%, (2) subject to user profile privacy settings, a successful infiltration can result in privacy breaches where even more private user data are exposed, (3) given the economics of today's underground markets, running a large-scale infiltration campaign might be profitable but is still not particularly attractive as a sustainable and independent business, (4) the security of socially-aware systems that use or integrate OSN platforms can be at risk, given the infiltration capability of an adversary in OSNs, and (5) defending against malicious socialbots raises a set of challenges that relate to web automation, online-offline identity binding, and usable security. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The pages of history are littered with incidents where rumours and half-truths have changed the political landscape. New technologies, concomitant applications and the rise of the citizen journalist have exponentially increased the scope, reach and spread of such rumours. Viral messaging is maturing and we will give examples of how rumour based video clips made by individuals have affected government and political life. We will also examine the rise of social networks as alternative spaces for political discourse. How are governments and politicians to respond? The recent paedophilia scandal in British politics and the use of social media, Twitter in particular, to spread the gossip has brought the issue of journalistic ethics to the fore. Government and democracy thrive on trust. The advent of 24-hour news and 24 hour politics places great pressure on institutions and individuals to manage their own image via structured information outputs. Rumour rebuttal is a key component of a successful campaign. This paper questions the root of our information sources. Social media has allowed rumour and gossip to take on new lives. Information can be spread (globally) at the click of a mouse. The danger, of course, is that there is no form of journalistic ethics or standards applied to such communication and this leads to a rise in misinformation. Journalists are forever on the hunt for a novel and exciting story, on occasion the source is the Internet and their verification of the story is debatable. We aim to explore the impact this has on government and democracy and stress the important of due diligence by journalists and society alike.

It is elevating the online public community to the status of first responders who can collectively cope with social crises. However, at the same time, many warnings have been raised about the reliability of community intelligence obtained through social reporting by the amateur online community. Using rumor theory, this paper studies citizen-driven information processing through Twitter services using data from three social crises: the Mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008, the Toyota recall in 2010, and the Seattle café shooting incident in 2012. We approach social crises as communal efforts for community intelligence gathering and collective information processing to cope with and adapt to uncertain external situations. We explore two issues: (1) collective social reporting as an information processing mechanism to address crisis problems and gather community intelligence, and (2) the degeneration of social reporting into collective rumor mills. Our analysis reveals that information with no clear source provided was the most important, personal involvement next in importance, and anxiety the least yet still important rumor causing factor on Twitter under social crisis situations.","Community intelligence; Extreme events; Rumor theory; Social crisis; Social information processing; Social reporting; Twitter",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876828845

One of the emerging tasks is to distinguish between different kinds of activities, for example engineered misinformation campaigns versus spontaneous communication. Such detection problems require a formal definition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to person through the social network. Once a meme is identified, supervised learning methods can be applied to classify different types of communication. The appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from existing entities such as tags and keywords. Here we present a framework for the novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of social data. We evaluate various similarity measures that leverage content, metadata, network features, and their combinations. We also explore the idea of pre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. A systematic evaluation is carried out using a manually curated dataset as ground truth. Our analysis shows that pre-clustering and a combination of heterogeneous features yield the best trade-off between number of clusters and their quality, demonstrating that a simple combination based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as effective as a non-trivial optimization of parameters.

As the node degree distribution is a salient property for process dynamics on complex networks, we use the well known Configuration Model, that captures generic degree distributions, for modeling and analysis. We also assume that information spreading between two neighboring nodes can only occur during random contact times. Using this model, we proceed to derive closed-form approximative formulas for the information spreading delay that only require the first and second moments of the node degree distribution.

However, they are still faces many challenges including routing security and privacy preservation.

This routing protocol has been extended to include the necessary parameters to perform the cryptographic operations at the nodes. Based on the cooperative neighbor and the short signatures technique, the proposed ECPDR scheme can not only detect and avoid but also can preserves the message privacy against elemental attacks and compound attacks.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was originally designed to simulate aggregate social behavior; our proposed diffusion model, PSODM (Particle Swarm Optimization Diffusion Model) models information flow in a network by creating particle swarms for local network neighborhoods that optimize a continuous version of Holland's hyperplane-defined objective functions. In this paper, we show how our approach differs from prior modeling work in the area and demonstrate that it outperforms existing model-based community detection methods on several social network datasets.

On the Internet, the paid posters represent a new type of online job opportunities. They get paid for posting comments or articles on different online communities and websites for hidden purposes, e.g., to influence the opinion of other people towards certain social events or business markets. While being an interesting strategy in business marketing, paid posters may create a significant negative effect on the online communities, since the information from paid posters is usually not trustworthy. When two competitive companies hire paid posters to post fake news or negative comments about each other, normal netizens may feel overwhelmed and find it difficult to put any trust in the information they acquire from the Internet. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the behavioral pattern of online paid posters based on real-world trace data. We design and validate a new detection mechanism, using both non-semantic analysis and semantic analysis, to identify potential online paid posters. Our test results with real-world datasets show a very promising performance. Copyright 2013 ACM.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893309191

This article uses an online survey to examine the impact of the German VAA (the ""Wahl-O-Mat"") on the political knowledge of its users concerning party positions during the 2009 German Federal Election. The article first assesses empirically the extent to which Wahl-O-Mat users are able to correctly identify party positions on relevant issues, and the extent to which they are misinformed. Multivariate analyses with a path model for categorical data are then undertaken to establish whether Wahl-O-Mat usage enhances political knowledge about party positions. It is shown that Wahl-O-Mat use has a positive effect on political knowledge, indicating that electoral effects can be partially explained by this change in the information level of users. However, it is also shown that political knowledge is very heterogeneous, and the level of confusion about party positions is high. © 2014 Policy Studies Organization.","2009 German Federal Election; misinformation; party positions; political knowledge; political online communication; VAAs; Voting Advice Applications; Wahl-O-Mat",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900869113

Variety of approaches that use natural language and statistical techniques failed to report high accuracy of tweets classification due to the nature of these tweets containing large number of abbreviations, emoticons and ill structured grammar.

To characterize rumor propagation in scale free networks, we propose a rumor spreading model which uses the acceptability factor to control the rumor. In this model we introduced a new compartment of stifler who rejects the rumor in comparison with existing SIR model. An ignorant can reject the rumor and become stifler when it gets rumor from a spreader. In this proposed rumor spreading model, random, targeted and neighbor inoculation strategies have been applied to control rumor in the scale free networks. The targeted inoculation strategy has been found to be more successful to control the rumor. If there is no global information of the network then targeted inoculation strategy cannot be applied. For this, neighbor inoculation technique is being used in the proposed model. It has been found to be much more efficient than random inoculation but less efficient than targeted inoculation scheme. In this paper the rumor acceptability factor (1/δ) has been studied for inoculation strategies. It has found that decreasing the acceptability factor with the inoculation strategies is much more efficient in controlling the rumor. © 2012 IEEE.","Information credibility; Information dynamics; Random; Rumor spreading model; Scale free networks; Targeted and neighbor inoculation",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874033967

How quickly does a piece of news spread over these media? How does its popularity diminish over time? Does the rising and falling pattern follow a simple universal law?

Our model has the following advantages: (a) unification power: it generalizes and explains earlier theoretical models and empirical observations; (b) practicality: it matches the observed behavior of diverse sets of real data; (c) parsimony: it requires only a handful of parameters; and (d) usefulness: it enables further analytics tasks such as fore- casting, spotting anomalies, and interpretation by reverse- engineering the system parameters of interest (e.g. quality of news, count of interested bloggers, etc.). Using SpikeM, we analyzed 7.2GB of real data, most of which were collected from the public domain. We have shown that our SpikeM model accurately and succinctly describes all the patterns of the rise-and-fall spikes in these real datasets. © 2012 ACM.","information diffusion; social networks",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866023367

In this paper, small world network model has been used to investigate the efficiency of inoculation. It has been found that if average degree of small world network is small than both inoculation methods are successful. When average degree is large, neither of these methods are able to stop rumor spreading. But if acceptability of rumor is reduced along with inoculation, the rumor spreading can be stopped even in this case.The proposed hypothesis has been verified using simulation experiments.

Initially, a single node knows of a rumor. In each succeeding round, every node chooses a random neighbor, and the two nodes share the rumor if one of them is already aware of it. We present the first theoretical analysis of this protocol on random graphs that have a power law degree distribution with an arbitrary exponent β > 2. Our main findings reveal a striking dichotomy in the performance of the protocol that depends on the exponent of the power law. More specifically, we show that if 2 < β < 3, then the rumor spreads to almost all nodes in Θ(log log n) rounds with high probability. On the other hand, if β > 3, then Ω(log n) rounds are necessary. We also investigate the asynchronous version of the push-pull protocol, where the nodes do not operate in rounds, but exchange information according to a Poisson process with rate 1. Surprisingly, we are able to show that, if 2 < β < 3, the rumor spreads even in constant time, which is much smaller than the typical distance of two nodes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that establishes a gap between the synchronous and the asynchronous protocol. Copyright © SIAM.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860123097

One of the main contributions of this paper is the critical analysis of the possible forms of deceptive behavior in social media and the state-of-the-art technologies for automated deception detection in social media. Based on the proposed taxonomy of major deception types, the assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages of the popular deception detection methods are analyzed. Our critical analysis shows that deceptive behavior may evolve over time, and so making it difficult for the existing methods to effectively detect social media spam. Accordingly, another main contribution of this paper is the design and development of a generic framework to combat dynamic deceptive activities in social media. The managerial implication of our research is that business managers or marketers will develop better insights about the possible deceptive behavior in social media before they tap into social media to collect and generate market intelligence. Moreover, they can apply the proposed adaptive deception detection framework to more effectively combat the ever increasing and evolving deceptive activities in social media.","Adaptive Deception Detection; Automated Deception Detection; Social Media; Social Media Spam",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928182704

As soon as the storm hit the festival tweet activity increased exponentially, peaking at 576 tweets per minute. The extraction tool enabled analyzing tweets through predefined (geo)graphical displays, message content filters (damage, casualties) and tweet type filters (e.g., retweets). Important topics that emerged were 'early warning tweets', 'rumors' and the 'self-organization of disaster relief' on Twitter.

However, alongside these promising features comes the threat of misinformation propagation which can lead to undesirable effects, such as the widespread panic in the general public due to faulty swine flu tweets on Twitter in 2009. Due to the huge magnitude of online social network (OSN) users and the highly clustered structures commonly observed in these kinds of networks, it poses a substantial challenge to efficiently contain viral spread of misinformation in large-scale social networks. In this paper, we focus on how to limit viral propagation of misinformation in OSNs. Particularly, we study a set of problems, namely the βTI -Node Protectors, which aims to find the smallest set of highly influential nodes whose decontamination with good information helps to contain the viral spread of misinformation, initiated from the set I, to a desired ratio (1 - β) in T time steps. In this family set, we analyze and present solutions including inapproximability result, greedy algorithms that provide better lower bounds on the number of selected nodes, and a community-based heuristic method for the Node Protector problems. To verify our suggested solutions, we conduct experiments on real world traces including NetHEPT, NetHEPT WC and Facebook networks. Empirical results indicate that our methods are among the best ones for hinting out those important nodes in comparison with other available methods.

Such a process, which has been intensively studied under the name of viral marketing, has the goal to select an initial good set of individuals that will promote a new idea (or message) by spreading the ""rumor"" within the entire social network through the word-of-mouth. Several studies used the linear threshold model where the group is represented by a graph, nodes have two possible states (active, non-active), and the threshold triggering the adoption (activation) of a new idea to a node is given by the number of the active neighbors. The problem of detecting in a graph the presence of the minimal number of nodes that will be able to activate the entire network is called target set selection (TSS). In this paper we extend TSS by allowing nodes to have more than two colors. The multicolored version of the TSS can be described as follows: let G be a torus where every node is assigned a color from a finite set of colors. At each local time step, each node can recolor itself, depending on the local configurations, with the color held by the majority of its neighbors. We study the initial distributions of colors leading the system to a monochromatic configuration of color k, focusing on the minimum number of initial k-colored nodes. We conclude the paper by providing the time complexity to achieve the monochromatic configuration. © 2011 IEEE.","Distributed algorithms; Dynamic monopolies",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83455248669

Specifically, we analyze microblog postings related to ""trending"" topics, and classify them as credible or not credible, based on features extracted from them. We use features from users' posting and re-posting (""re-tweeting"") behavior, from the text of the posts, and from citations to external sources. We evaluate our methods using a significant number of human assessments about the credibility of items on a recent sample of Twitter postings.

In this study, we put the theme under the circumstances of online social networks like twitter, which is different from traditional social network websites. Assuming that the structure of these websites is a kind of scale free network, we build a specific agent-based model using Net Logo based on the propagation model of SIR.

The problem can be summarized as identifying a subset of individuals that need to be convinced to adopt the competing (or ""good"") campaign so as to minimize the number of people that adopt the ""bad"" campaign at the end of both propagation processes. We show that this optimization problem is NP-hard and provide approximation guarantees for a greedy solution for various definitions of this problem by proving that they are submodular. We experimentally compare the performance of the greedy method to various heuristics. The experiments reveal that in most cases inexpensive heuristics such as degree centrality compare well with the greedy approach. We also study the influence limitation problem in the presence of missing data where the current states of nodes in the network are only known with a certain probability and show that prediction in this setting is a supermodular problem. We propose a prediction algorithm that is based on generating random spanning trees and evaluate the performance of this approach. The experiments reveal that using the prediction algorithm, we are able to tolerate about 90% missing data before the performance of the algorithm starts degrading and even with large amounts of missing data the performance degrades only to 75% of the performance that would be achieved with complete data.

Politicians, celebrities, revolutionists, and others use OSNs as a podium to deliver their message to millions of active web users. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, OSNs can be used to run astroturf campaigns to spread misinformation and propaganda. Such campaigns usually start off by infiltrating a targeted OSN on a large scale. In this paper, we evaluate how vulnerable OSNs are to a large-scale infiltration by socialbots: computer programs that control OSN accounts and mimic real users. We adopt a traditional web-based botnet design and built a Socialbot Network (SbN): a group of adaptive socialbots that are orchestrated in a command-and-control fashion. We operated such an SbN on Facebook-a 750 million user OSN-for about 8 weeks. We collected data related to users' behavior in response to a large-scale infiltration where socialbots were used to connect to a large number of Facebook users. Our results show that (1) OSNs, such as Facebook, can be infiltrated with a success rate of up to 80%, (2) depending on users' privacy settings, a successful infiltration can result in privacy breaches where even more users' data are exposed when compared to a purely public access, and (3) in practice, OSN security defenses, such as the Facebook Immune System, are not effective enough in detecting or stopping a large-scale infiltration as it occurs.

How we choose to use digital image processing raises a surprising host of legal and ethical questions that we must address. What are the ramifications of hiding data within an innocent image? Is this an intentional security practice when used legitimately, or intentional deception? Is tampering with an image appropriate in cases where the image might affect public behavior? Does an image represent a crime, or is it simply a representation of a scene that has never existed? Before action can even be taken on the basis of a questionable image, we must detect something about the image itself. Investigators from a diverse set of fields require the best possible tools to tackle the challenges presented by the malicious use of today's digital image processing techniques. In this survey, we introduce the emerging field of digital image forensics, including the main topic areas of source camera identification, forgery detection, and steganalysis. In source camera identification, we seek to identify the particular model of a camera, or the exact camera, that produced an image. Forgery detection's goal is to establish the authenticity of an image, or to expose any potential tampering the image might have undergone. With steganalysis, the detection of hidden data within an image is performed, with a possible attempt to recover any detected data. Each of these components of digital image forensics is described in detail, along with a critical analysis of the state of the art, and recommendations for the direction of future research. © 2011 ACM.","Forgery and fraud detection; Hidden messages detection; Image and video forensics; Image and video source identification; Legal aspects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80155180685

One approach to simulate these diffusion processes is to generate random or stylized networks. Normally, random, small world, and scale-free network generation algorithms are used to that end. However, the structure of the network is an important parameter for the pattern of diffusion. Therefore, the model has to fit the properties of the corresponding system. The first questions for this article are: What are the characteristics of real world interpersonal networks and which network generation algorithm fits these characteristics? Based on this examination, a new and simple to implement algorithm is introduced to generate stylized networks for modeling the diffusion of information, opinions, and messages in real world social networks by interpersonal communication. Our work also shows the connectivity of empirically collected ego networks and algorithmically generated overall networks and offers correspondences between the micro and the macro level. It is therefore possible to use micro knowledge about networks to calibrate macro networks.

In this study, the paper investigates the role microblogs play by exploring the types of messages following the death of a public figure, Michael Jackson, “the King of Pop”. Design/methodology/approach – Content analysis was conducted using 50,000 tweets harvested from Twitter from the first 12 days after Michael Jackson's death. A coding instrument characterizing a set of categories that users posted about Jackson's death was inductively constructed, and then applied to the entire dataset of tweets. Findings – About 50 per cent of tweets fell into categories commonly associated with expressions of emotions or thoughts due to death. However, as the single largest category, Twitter was used primarily as a platform for sharing news and other information. Surprisingly, categories not normally associated with grieving, such as spreading of rumours, expressions of hatred and spam, also occupied a high proportion of tweets. Originality/value – There has been little work done in examining microblogs as platforms for giving and receiving support in general and, more specifically, for the expression of grief. Therefore, the present research is timely, as it seeks to understand the role microblogs play in the grieving process. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Content analysis; Death; Grieving; Loss; Microblogs",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053074860

In light of these notable outcomes, understanding information diffusion over online social networks is a critical research goal. Because many social interactions currently take place in online networks, we now have have access to unprecedented amounts of information about social interaction. Prior to the advent of such online networks, investigations about social behavior required resource-intensive activities such as random trials, surveys, and manual data collection to gather even small data sets. Now, massive amounts of information about social networks and social interactions are recorded. This wealth of data can allow us to study social interactions on a scale and at a level of detail that has never before been possible. We present an integrated approach to information diffusion in online social networks focusing on three key problems: (1) Querying and analysis of online social network datasets; (2) Modeling and analysis of social networks; and (3) Analysis of social media and social interactions in the contemporary media environment. The overarching goals are to generate a greater understanding of social interactions in online networks through data analysis, to develop reliable and scalable models that can predict outcomes of these social processes, and ultimately to create applications that can shape the outcome of these processes. We start by developing and refining models of information diffusion based on real-world data sets. We next address the problem of finding influential users in this data-driven framework. It is equally important to identify techniques that can slow or prevent the spread of misinformation, and hence algorithms are explored to address this question. A third interest is the process by which a social group forms opinions about an idea or product, and we therefore describe preliminary approaches to create models that accurately capture the opinion formation process in online social networks. While questions relating to the propagation of a single news item or idea are important, these information campaigns do not exist in isolation. Therefore, our proposed approach also addresses the interplay of the many information diffusion processes that take place simultaneously in a network and the relative importance of different topics or trends over multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Data Analysis; Information propagation; Social Networks; Sub-modular optimization",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052731898

It has been observed that information spreads extremely fast in social networks. We study the performance of randomized rumor spreading protocols on graphs in the preferential attachment model. The well-known random phone call model of Karp et al. (FOCS 2000) is a push-pull strategy where in each round, each vertex chooses a random neighbor and exchanges information with it. We prove the following. • The push-pull strategy delivers a message to all nodes within Θ(log n) rounds with high probability. The best known bound so far was O(log2 n). • If we slightly modify the protocol so that contacts are chosen uniformly from all neighbors but the one contacted in the previous round, then this time reduces to Θ(log n / log log n), which is the diameter of the graph. This is the first time that a sublogarithmic broadcast time is proven for a natural setting. Also, this is the first time that avoiding double-contacts reduces the run-time to a smaller order of magnitude. © 2011 ACM.","randomized algorithms; rumor spreading; social network",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959760477

Rumor spreading is one of the basic mechanisms for information dissemination in networks; its relevance stemming from its simplicity of implementation and effectiveness. In this paper, we study the performance of rumor spreading in the classic preferential attachment model of Bollobs et al. which is considered to be a valuable model for social networks. We prove that, in these networks: (a) The standard PUSHPULL strategy delivers the message to all nodes within O(log2n) rounds with high probability; (b) by themselves, PUSH and PULL require polynomially many rounds. (These results are under the assumption that m, the number of new links added with each new node is at least 2. If m=1 the graph is disconnected with high probability, so no rumor spreading strategy can work.) Our analysis is based on a careful study of some new properties of preferential attachment graphs which could be of independent interest. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Then amulti-agent rumor spread model in virtual community is established based on the analysis of rumor spread pattern. According to the proposed model, some simulations are conducted to show the impact of network structure, tolerance frequency, and believing rate to rumor spread. It is also concluded that in this kind of virtual community, rumor cannot be eliminated and its spread is also insufficient; each node’s tolerance frequency can greatly reduce the prevalence of rumor duration; believing rate of each node can change nodes’ trusting states to rumor obviously in the spread process.

This study explores the working dynamics of the rumor mill by analyzing Twitter data of the Haiti Earthquake in 2010. For this analysis, two key variables of anxiety and informational uncertainty are derived from rumor theory, and their interactive dynamics are measured by both quantitative and qualitative methods.

The research on social system's dynamics, such as epidemic or rumor spreading, are often suffered from constraints of relatively small to medium scale networks, or dependence on the underlying network assumptions, resulting in limited capacity for dynamics prediction. This paper proposes SUPE-Net, an efficient parallel simulation environment for large-scale social networks. Built on parallel discrete event simulation engine, the SUPE-Net enables high fidelity modeling of social networks with different topologies and complex dynamics protocols. SUPE-Net automatically maps large-scale social networks onto multi-processors and adopts the discrete event fashion to study the complex network dynamics. Different network topologies, including random, small-world, scale-free, and real networks, can be easily constructed and plugged in for comparative study. The execution efficiency of SUPE-Net is demonstrated by simulation experiments of gossip dynamics on the actor networks with millions of entities. © 2010 IEEE.","Large-scale social network; Parallel simulation environment; Social dynamics simulation",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953087405

In the context of the spread of a disease or undesirable behavior, it is important to identify blockers: individuals that are most effective in stopping or slowing down the spread of a process through the population. This problem has so far resisted systematic algorithmic solutions. In an effort to formulate practical solutions, in this paper we ask:Are there structural network measures that are indicative of the best blockers in dynamic social networks? Our contribution is two-fold. First, we extend standard structural network measures to dynamic networks. Second, we compare the blocking ability of individuals in the order of ranking by the new dynamic measures. We found that overall, simple ranking according to a node's static degree, or the dynamic version of a node's degree, performed consistently well. Surprisingly the dynamic clustering coefficient seems to be a good indicator, while its static version performs worse than the random ranking. This provides simple practical and locally computable algorithms for identifying key blockers in a network. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650226137

The study of movement behavior of spatiotemporal entities helps enhance the quality of service in decision-making in real applications. However, the spread of certain entities such as diseases or rumor is difficult to observe compared to the movement of people, vehicles, or animals. We can only infer their locations in a certain region of space-time on the basis of observable events. In this paper, we propose a new model, called as moving phenomenon, to represent time-varying phenomena over geotime-tagged contents on the Web. The most important feature of this model is the integration of thematic dimension into an event-based spatiotemporal data model. By using the proposed model, a user can aggregate relevant contents relating to an interesting phenomenon and perceive its movement behavior; further, the model also enables a user to navigate the spatial, temporal, and thematic information of the contents along all the three-dimensions. Finally, we present an example of typhoons to illustrate moving phenomena and draw a comparison between the movement of the moving phenomenon created using information from news articles on the Web and that of the actual typhoon. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75649088129

Rumor spreading is one of the basic mechanisms for information dissemination in networks, its relevance stemming from its simplicity of implementation and effectiveness. In this paper, we study the performance of rumor spreading in the classic preferential attachment model of Bollobás et al. which is considered to be a valuable model for social networks. We prove that, in these networks: (a) The standard PUSH-PULL strategy delivers the message to all nodes within O(log 2 n) rounds with high probability; (b) by themselves, PUSH and PULL require polynomially many rounds. (These results are under the assumption that m, the number of new links added with each new node is at least 2. If m=1 the graph is disconnected with high probability, so no rumor spreading strategy can work.) Our analysis is based on a careful study of some new properties of preferential attachment graphs which could be of independent interest. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449103321

For example, the spread of news and rumors all take place by contact between individuals. Rumors or news can spread far faster over a network in which the average degree of separation is low, than it can over a network in which the average degree of separation is high. Location-based applications are one of the most anticipated new segments of the mobile industry. These new applications are enabled by GPS-equipped phones (e.g., emergency applications, buddy finders, games, location-based advertising ...etc.) These services are designed to give consumers instant access to personalized, local content of their immediate location. Some applications couple LBS with notification services, automatically alerting users when they are close to a pre-selected destination. With the advances in the Internet and communications/mobile technology, it became vital to analyze the effect of such technologies on human communications. This work studies how humans can construct social networks as a method for group communications using the available technologies. We built a PDA application that implements the concept of LBS using two system modules. In the first module, we have developed an application for entertainment purposes; an application program which enables end users to send their birth year and get their horoscope in return. The second part of the project was, to build an application which helps people to stay in touch with their friends and family members (Find Friend).

Consequently, in our social gossip a message is adopted only when it is received over a threshold of independent paths.

Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of analysis of cases and ontology engineering. A formal schema is provided for the model. The way information can be organized according to this is illustrated with examples about life facts and rumours regarding a popular Hollywood actress. Findings - Some web systems that exploit the representation of personal relationships for purposes such as finding jobs or business opportunities have gained popularity recently. These systems enable users to take advantage of their personal information when combined with information provided by others who are willing to attain similar objectives. However, the importance of that kind of social information can also be applied to other fields in which the information is not directly provided by users, but comes from historical evidence or indirect sources. This is especially relevant to creating knowledge representations that attempt to reconstruct the social networks of celebrities or historical characters. Originality/value - The model described in this paper can be used to gain insight regarding the historical course of their lives, and of their work relationships, as affected by personal ties.

While trust aware gossiping significantly reduced the rumor spread on the network, we observed that the random message spraying in trusted gossip creates too many redundant messages increasing the message overhead and error rate. In this paper, we propose a message targeting scheme that can significantly improve the performance of the trusted gossip. Our targeting scheme can be easily implemented in a social network setting. We performed large-scale simulations using traces collected from the Flickr social network and other data sets to estimate the performance of targeting in trusted gossip. Our experiments show that significant performance gains can be achieved. © 2007 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548716338

This can be very influential in a text-based domain. In recent years, tools have been developed that, while not initially designed for this domain, have been adapted successfully for use in identifying deception in text-based communication. These text analysis tools, which utilize features such as parsing and categorizing, are emerging as accurate tools to identify cues that may be useful in distinguishing deceptive from truthful communications. These deception detection tools have been applied to problems such as security screening, criminal incident statements, and evaluation of online communication patterns. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the features and capabilities of two of the more promising tools and identifies how their use might fit within existing theoretical constructs.","Cues; Deception; Deception detection; Linguistic analysis; Text",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870316260

Indeed, a shared interest in network structure is arguably one of the forces that is helping draw many of these disciplines closer together. As one aspect of this broader theme, we consider a convergence of ideas taking place at the boundary between distributed computer networks and human social networks - the former consisting of computing devices linked by an underlying communication medium, and the latter consisting of people and organizations in society connected by ties that represent friendship, interaction, and influence. Distributed computing systems have long been intertwined with the social networks that link their user populations. Recent developments, however, have added further dimensions to this relationship: the growth of blogging, social networking services, and other forms of social media on the Internet have made large-scale social networks more transparent to the general public than ever before. They have also raised new research challenges at the interface of computer science and the social sciences - challenges in which the study of distributed computing has the potential to provide considerable insight. We discuss three related areas that illustrate the issues at this interface. The first is centered around the small-world phenomenon - the premise that most pairs of individuals in a social network are linked by very short paths (or ""six degrees of separation"") [36]. In earlier work, we proposed that the social-psychology experiments providing the first empirical evidence for the phenomenon [25, 35] were related in fundamental ways to the problem of decentralized routing [14], and this theme has been pursued in a number of subsequent papers (e.g. [5, 8, 15, 17, 24, 29, 31, 32]). This line of research has helped to abstract some of the general principles underlying random graphs in which decentralized routing and search are feasible - structures in which local information is sufficient to reach designated targets in the network. In the process, close connections have been developed to research in the design of decentralized peer-to-peer systems [3, 20, 21, 22, 23], and some of the patterns suggested by the basic models of small-world networks have been borne out to a striking extent by empirical studies of social network structure [2, 19]. As a second area, we consider cascading behavior and the diffusion of information in networks. Rumors, fads, innovations, social movements, and diseases spread through human social networks [9, 28, 30, 33] in much the way that information propagates through a distributed system. And as with small-world networks, the analogies between the computational and social versions of these phenomena turn out to be deep rather than superficial. One of the oldest connections here was the pioneering work on epidemic algorithms presented by Demers et al. at PODC 1987 [6], in which probabilistic rules for information dissemination in distributed systems are modeled on aspects of biological epidemics (see [12] for a recent overview of this topic). Recent work has exploited similar analogies in the development of viral marketing strategies to promote new innovations by word-of-mouth effects [7, 13, 18, 27], in the growth of on-line communities and social networking sites [4], and in the analysis of information cascades among weblogs [1, 10]. Finally, we consider game-theoretic models for these types of search and diffusion processes. The use of game theory to analyze networks of interacting strategic agents has become an active area of research in computer science (see e.g. [11, 26, 34]); in the present context we can ask how the introduction of economic incentives affects the performance of decentralized search or information diffusion algorithms. In particular, if the intermediaries on a path from a query to an answer require compensation for their participation in the search, then the dynamics of the system depend crucially on both the structure of the network and on the rarity of the answer; the resulting analysis leads to natural questions related to strategic behavior in branching processes [16].","Algorithmic game theory; Distributed systems; Small-world phenomenon; Social networks",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748707772

In human societies, each individual determine who collaborate with, and this selected group forms a social network that will improve the quality of the decisions of individuals. Several models of computation have been proposed in literature. Among them, the approach of the authors relies on the ability of fuzzy logic to operate with vague and uncertain terms. This paper studies how much effective is the cooperation between agents modelled by these proposals in different scenarios. The scenarios test the evolution of the deception caused by overvalued/undervalued predictions, with cooperation of low/high reliability, and with three different levels of variability in the behaviour of the agents evaluated. © - IOS Press and the authors.

Recently cognitive hacking was defined as an attack directed at the mind of the user of a computer system [2]. Countermeasures against cognitive and semantic attacks are expected to play an important role in a new science of intelligence and security informatics. Information retrieval, or document retrieval, developed historically to serve the needs of scientists and legal researchers, among others. In these domains, documents are expected to be honest representations of attempts to discover scientific truths, or to make sound legal arguments. This assumption does not hold for intelligence and security informatics. Intelligence and security informatics will be supported by data mining, visualization, and link analysis technology, but intelligence and security analysts should also be provided with an analysis environment supporting mixed-initiative, utility-theoretic interaction with both raw and aggregated data. This environment should include toolkits of semantic hacking countermeasures. For example, faced with a potentially deceptive news item, an automated countermeasure might provide an alert using adaptive fraud detection algorithms [3], or through a retrieval mechanism allow the analyst to quickly assemble and analyze related documents bearing on the potential misinformation.
